As moderators, we will attempt to guide the discussion. You will each receive one minute to answer questions, 30 seconds for responses and rebuttals, and 15 additional seconds if a moderator asks for a clarification. The timing lights will remind you of these limits. Please respect them and please refrain from interrupting other candidates during their allotted time. A candidate infringing on another candidate\u2019s time will have his or her time reduced.

Why do we need to do it? We already automated away millions of manufacturing jobs and chances are your job could be next. If you don\u2019t believe me, just ask an auto worker here in Detroit. How do we pay for it? Raise your hand in the crowd if you\u2019ve seen stores closing where you live. It is not just you, Amazon is closing 30% of America\u2019s stores and malls and paying zero in taxes while doing it. We need to do the opposite of much of what we\u2019re doing right now. And the opposite of Donald Trump is an Asian man who likes math. So let me share the math. On $1,000 a month for every adult would be $461 million every month right here in Detroit alone.

Listening to experts, listening to healthcare providers and what I came away with is a very clear understanding that I needed to create a plan that was responsive to the needs of the American people. Responsive to their needs, understanding that insurance companies have been jacking up the prices for far too long. That American families have to be held down by deductibles and copays and premiums that can cause them bankruptcy."}, {"speaker": "Kamala Harris", "time": "15:22", "text": "I listened to the American families who said four years is just not enough to transition into this new plan. So I devised a plan where it\u2019s going to be 10 years of a transition. I listened to American families who said, I want an option that will be under your Medicare system that allows a private plan. So I designed a plan where yes, responsive to the needs of American families, there will be a public plan under my plan for Medicare and a private plan under my plan for Medicare. Because the bottom line is this, we must agree that access to healthcare must be a right and not just a privilege of those who can afford it.

If you noticed there\u2019s no talk about the fact that the plan in 10 years will cost $3 trillion. You will lose your employer based insurance.

Unfortunately, Vice President Biden, you\u2019re just simply inaccurate in what you\u2019re describing. The reality is that our plan will bring healthcare to all Americans under a Medicare For All system. Our plan will allow people to start signing up on the first day. Babies will be born into our plan and right now four million babies almost are born every day in America or every year in America. Under our plan, we will ensure that everyone has access to healthcare. Your plan by contrast, leaves out almost 10 million Americans.

What to speak of the fact that it would have a negative impact on domestic jobs and that it lacked clear protections for our environment.

When asked whether or not the president could be charged with a crime after leaving office, his answer was yes. Senator Harris, you\u2019ve criticized President Trump for interfering with the justice department. And, just last month, you said if you were elected president your Justice Department would, \u201cHave no choice and should go forward with obstruction of justice charges against Former President Trump.\u201d Why is it okay for you to advocate for the Justice Department to prosecute somebody but, President Trump, not him?"}, {"speaker": "Kamala Harris", "time": "22:45", "text": "Well, I would never direct the Department of Justice to do whatever it believes it should do. But listen, look, we all watched his testimony. I read the report. There are 10 clear incidents of obstruction of justice by this president and he needs to be held accountable. I\u2019ve seen people go to prison for far less. And the reality of it is that we have a person in the White House right now who has been shielded by a memo in the United States Department of Justice that says a sitting president cannot be indicted. I believe the American people are right to say there should be consequence and accountability for everyone and no one is above the law, including the President of the United States,"}, {"speaker": "Jake Tapper", "time": "23:25", "text": "Senator Booker, your response?"}, {"speaker": "Cory Booker", "time": "23:28", "text": "My response is exactly that. I\u2019ve read the report, I\u2019ve read the redacted versions of the report. We have something that is astonishing going on the United States of America. We have a president that is not acting like the leader of the free world. He\u2019s acting like an authoritarian against the actual Constitution that he swore an oath to uphold. And so this is a difference with a lot of us on this debate stage. I believe that we, in the United States Congress, should start impeachment proceedings immediately. And I\u2019ll tell you this, Debbie Stabenow has joined my call for starting impeachment proceedings. Because he is now stonewalling congress, not allowing or subjecting himself to the checks and balances. We swore an oath to uphold the Constitution. The politics of this be damned. When we look back in history at what happened when a President of the United States started acting more like an authoritarian leader than the leader of the free world, the question is what will we have done? And I believe the congress should do its job."}, {"speaker": "Jake Tapper", "time": "24:27", "text": "Senator Booker, thank you very much.

I was the first of the candidates to call on congress to begin impeachment proceedings. There are 10 different instances that Robert Mueller has pointed out where this president either obstructed justice or attempted to obstruct justice. And I believe that they should go forward with impeachment proceedings. As to the question of what my Department of Justice would do, I agree with those who say that a president should not direct an attorney general specifically to prosecute or not prosecute. However, I believe that the evidence is plain and clear and that if it gets that far that you\u2019re likely to see a prosecution of Donald Trump."}, {"speaker": "Jake Tapper", "time": "25:04", "text": "Thank you, secretary.

But I want to caution my fellow Democrats, while we move in every way we can for impeachment, we have to remember at the same time the American people are out there looking for us to do something for them in their lives. And what they see when they turn on the TV or go online is just talk about impeachment. We need more talk about working people and their lives. For example, are we really ready? And I ask people on this stage this question, are we ready to make sure that the wealthy pay their fair share in taxes? That\u2019s something every American wants to know about. That\u2019s something they want answers to right now. So yeah, move for impeachment. But don\u2019t forget to do the people\u2019s business and to stand up for working people.

And I just want to make sure whatever we do doesn\u2019t end up with an acquittal by Mitch McConnell in the Senate, which it surely would. And then President Trump would be running saying that he had been acquitted by the United States Congress. I believe we have a moral obligation to beat Donald Trump. He has to be a single-term president and we can\u2019t do anything that plays into his hands. We were talking earlier about climate up here, it\u2019s so important.

At the same time, senator, I think that too many folks in the senate and in the congress had been spooked by 1998. I believe that the times are different. And, in fact, I think that folks are making a mistake by not pursuing impeachment. The Mueller Report clearly details that he deserves it.
