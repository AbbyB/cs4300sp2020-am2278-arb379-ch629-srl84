Vice President Biden, the first question is for you. In the last few days, you\u2019ve been saying that Democrats will be taking too big a risk if they nominate Senator Sanders or Mayor Buttigieg, but they came out on top in Iowa. What risks did the Iowa Democrats miss?"}, {"speaker": "Joe Biden", "time": "00:32", "text": "Oh, they didn\u2019t miss anything. It\u2019s a long race. I took a hit in Iowa and I\u2019ll probably take a hit here. Traditionally Bernie won by 20 points last time. And usually it\u2019s the neighboring senators that do well. But no matter what, I\u2019m still in this for the same reason, we have to restore the soul of this country, bring back the middle class and make sure we bring people together. And so it\u2019s a simple proposition. It doesn\u2019t matter whether it\u2019s this one or the next. I\u2019ve always viewed the first four encounters, two primaries, and two caucuses as the starting point. And so that\u2019s how I view it."}, {"speaker": "George S.", "time": "01:08", "text": "Why are Senator Sanders and Mayor Buttigieg too big a risk for Democrats?"}, {"speaker": "Joe Biden", "time": "01:12", "text": "Well, you know that with regard to Senator Sanders, the President wants very much to sic a label on every candidate. We\u2019re going to not only have to win this time, we have to bring along the United States Senate. And Bernie\u2019s labeled himself, not me, a democratic socialist. I think that\u2019s the label that the President\u2019s going to lay on everyone running with Bernie if he\u2019s a nominee. And a Mayor Buttigieg is a great guy and a real patriot. He\u2019s a mayor of a small city, who has done some good things but has not demonstrated he has the ability to, and we\u2019ll soon find out, to get a broad scope of support across the spectrum, including African Americans and Latinos."}, {"speaker": "George S.", "time": "01:53", "text": "Senator Sanders, let me give you the chance to respond first. President Trump certainly thinks this label socialism will work. At the State of the Union, he said, \u201cSocialism destroys nations. He\u2019s never going to let socialism destroy American healthcare.\u201d And before the Super Bowl, he joked was Sean Hannity about your honeymoon in Moscow. Those hits are going to keep coming if you\u2019re the nominee. Why shouldn\u2019t Democrats be worried?"}, {"speaker": "Bernie Sanders", "time": "02:14", "text": "Because Donald Trump lies all the time. It doesn\u2019t matter what Donald Trump says, it\u2019s a sad state of affairs, it really is. He will say terrible things about Joe, he has [inaudible 00:02:32] ugly, disgusting things about Elizabeth, about Amy, about anybody else who was up here. But I think George, that at the end of the day, the way we defeat Donald Trump and everybody up here by the way, is united. No matter who wins this damn thing, we\u2019re all going to stand together to defeat Donald Trump."}, {"speaker": "Bernie Sanders", "time": "02:55", "text": "I believe that the way we beat Trump is by having the largest voter turnout in the history of this country. And that is appealing to working class people, who have given up on the political process because they don\u2019t believe that anybody is hearing their pain, perceiving that pain, feeling their pain. And we got to bring young people into the political process. I am very proud that in Iowa we won the popular vote by 6,000 votes. What was most significant, most significant, is we increased voter turnout for young people under 29 by over 30%. If we do that nationally, we\u2019re going to defeat Donald Trump."}, {"speaker": "George S.", "time": "03:34", "text": "But Senator, let me follow up there and then we\u2019ll move on. But back in Iowa, the turn out this year was about the same as it was in 2016. Far below what it was in 2008 when President Obama won."}, {"speaker": "Bernie Sanders", "time": "03:46", "text": "That\u2019s true. And that\u2019s the disappointment and I think all of us probably could have done a better job in bringing out our supporters. But if there is a good spot, a good aspect about that campaign, is that young people came out in higher numbers than they did during Obama\u2019s historic 2008 campaign. And if that happens nationally, we\u2019re going to win and defeat Trump."}, {"speaker": "George S.", "time": "04:09", "text": "Before I move on to Mayor Buttigieg, let me just ask, is anyone else on the stage concerned about having a democratic socialist at the top of the Democratic ticket?"}, {"speaker": "Bernie Sanders", "time": "04:20", "text": "I\u2019m not."}, {"speaker": "George S.", "time": "04:21", "text": "Senator Klobuchar."}, {"speaker": "Amy Klobuchar", "time": "04:24", "text": "Bernie and I work together all the time. But I think we are not going to be able to out divide the divider in chief. And I think we need someone to head up this ticket that actually brings people with her, instead of shutting them out. And when I look at a state like New Hampshire that had a very, very close election last time in 2016, I see a state that, yes, has a high voter turnout, fired-up Democrats just like my state, which by the way, Bernie, when I led the ticket, had the highest voter turnout of any state in the country. But I add to that being able to bring in independents like you have in this state as well as moderate Republicans. Because there are so many of them out there that are looking for a candidate. And truthfully, Donald Trump\u2019s worst nightmare is a candidate that will bring people in from the middle. The people that are tired of the noise and the nonsense. And they are tired of the tweets and the mean stuff and they are looking for someone else. And I would submit that that is me."}, {"speaker": "George S.", "time": "05:29", "text": "Mr. Steyer, is socialism [inaudible 00:05:33]"}, {"speaker": "Tom Steyer", "time": "05:34", "text": "I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any question, George, that after this week there\u2019s a real threat that Donald Trump can get reelected. And I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any question, but that the only way that we\u2019re going to beat him actually is the way that Bernie Sanders said, which is to get turnout across the spectrum of democratic voters. And that means we\u2019re going to have to appeal across the spectrum, moderates, progressives and every group. So unless you can appeal to the diverse parts of the Democratic Party, including specifically the black community, including specifically Latinos. If you can\u2019t do that, then we can\u2019t beat Donald Trump in November and we can\u2019t choose a candidate who can\u2019t do that. And I am doing that right now with 24% of blacks down in South Carolina, with high numbers in Nevada. That\u2019s what it\u2019s going to take is turnout, but turnout across the spectrum of democratic voters. Someone who can pull, as Amy said, everything together in every single way we\u2019re divided."}, {"speaker": "George S.", "time": "06:35", "text": "Andrew Yang and Senator Warren then Mayor Buttigieg."}, {"speaker": "Andrew Yang", "time": "06:39", "text": "First, let me say America, it\u2019s great to be back on the debate stage. Thank you. I\u2019m so excited, I want to give every American $1,000 a month. George, the entire capitalism, socialism dichotomy is completely out of date and the fact is when people were talking about these economic models, they did not foresee technology getting stronger, more powerful, capable of doing the work of thousands of humans in the blink of an eye. We have record high corporate profits in this country right now, but people in New Hampshire know, what else are at record highs? Mental illness, stress, debt, substance abuse, overdoses, suicides. What we have to do is actually get the markets working to improve our family\u2019s way of life. Instead of following GDP and corporate profits off a cliff, we should be measuring our own health and wellness, life expectancy, mental health and freedom from substance abuse, clean air, and clean water, how our kids are doing. The way forward is a new human centered version of capitalism that actually uses the markets to improve our family\u2019s lives."}, {"speaker": "George S.", "time": "07:46", "text": "Senator Warren, you reportedly said back in 2018, \u201cI\u2019m a capitalist to my bones.\u201d Senator Sanders says, \u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d Is that your biggest difference with Senator Sanders?"}, {"speaker": "Elizabeth Warren", "time": "07:57", "text": "Oh, Bernie and I have been friends for a long time and we have a lot of things in common and we can have a lot of things that we differ on. But there\u2019s fundamental question about how we bring our party together. We have to think about it in new ways. People across this country, whether they\u2019re Democrats, independents, or Republicans, understand that we\u2019ve got a government right now that works great for those at the top. Works great for giant drug companies, just not for people trying to get a prescription filled. Works great for oil companies that want to drill everywhere, just not for the rest of us who see climate change bearing down upon us. When you see a government that works great for those who can hire armies of lobbyists and lawyers and make big campaign donations and it\u2019s not working so great for everyone else, that is corruption, pure and simple, and we need to call it out for what it is. Corruption, and that\u2019s what we can run on. We bring our party together."}, {"speaker": "Elizabeth Warren", "time": "08:54", "text": "It\u2019s an issue we can all agree on and fight for to end the corruption. We\u2019re the Democrats, we should be the party on the side of hardworking people and we can bring in independents and Republicans on that. They hate the corruption as well. My anti-corruption plan, good for Republicans and Democrats. That\u2019s not only how we bring our party together. That\u2019s how we\u2019re going to win in November."}, {"speaker": "George S.", "time": "09:21", "text": "Mayor Buttigieg, early in the campaign you said that the word socialism has lost its power, it\u2019s mostly lost its meaning. Do you believe that or worry it could be a potent weapon in a general election?"}, {"speaker": "Pete Buttigieg", "time": "09:32", "text": "I\u2019m not interested in the labels. I\u2019m not interested in what Republicans are going to say. I\u2019m interested in the style of politics that we need to put forward to actually, finally turn the page. In order to win, yes, but also in order to govern. This is a moment where the next president is going to face challenges the likes of which we hadn\u2019t even thought of a few years or decades ago. And politically, we\u2019re facing a fundamentally new problem with President Donald Trump. So the biggest risk we could take at a time like this would be to go up against that fundamentally new challenge by trying to fall back on the familiar. Or trying to unite this country at a moment when we need that kind of unification, when our nominee is dividing people with a politics that says, if you don\u2019t go all the way to the edge, it doesn\u2019t count. A politics that says, it\u2019s my way or the highway."}, {"speaker": "George S.", "time": "10:32", "text": "Are you talking about Senator Sanders?"}, {"speaker": "Pete Buttigieg", "time": "10:32", "text": "Yes. Because we\u2019ve got to bring as many people as we can into this process. Look, all of us have been saying that we can build the majority that it\u2019s going to take in order to win. But the process of actually proving it is now underway. And now it comes to New Hampshire, a state that thinks for itself, is not going to be told what to do by anyone and that has a very independent streak that is going to respond to those who are reaching out in a politics of addition and inclusion and belonging. Not one that beats people over the head and says they shouldn\u2019t even be on their side if we don\u2019t agree 100% of the time."}, {"speaker": "George S.", "time": "11:11", "text": "Senator Sanders, your response."}, {"speaker": "Bernie Sanders", "time": "11:13", "text": "Needless to say, I\u2019ve never said that, but let me tell you what I do say. The way you bring people together is by presenting an agenda that works for the working people of this country, not for the billionaire class. The way you bring people together, Republicans, independents, Democrats, progressives, conservatives, you raise the minimum wage to 15 bucks an hour. The way you bring people together is to make it clear that we\u2019re not going to give tax breaks to billionaires and large corporations, they\u2019re going to start paying their fair share of taxes. That\u2019s what the American people want. And I\u2019ll tell you something else, the way you bring people together is by ending the international disgrace of this country being the only major nation on Earth not to guarantee healthcare to all people as a human right. And you bring people together by telling the pharmaceutical industry they\u2019re not going to charge us 10 times more for the same prescription drugs as the people in Canada that borders on New Hampshire. That\u2019s how you bring people together and you defeat Donald Trump."}, {"speaker": "George S.", "time": "12:27", "text": "Mayor Buttigieg, you just heard Senator Sanders make healthcare the center of his piece. Do you think his healthcare plan can bring people together?"}, {"speaker": "Pete Buttigieg", "time": "12:34", "text": "I think there\u2019s a better way. It\u2019s true, the American people are ready. There\u2019s a historic majority right now, even broader than what was available to President Obama a decade ago. There is now a majority ready to act to make sure there is no such thing as an uninsured American and no such thing as an unaffordable prescription. Just so long as we don\u2019t command people to accept a public plan if they don\u2019t want to. That\u2019s the idea of Medicare for All Who Want It. My point is, what I am offering is campaigning for all of these things that America wants. Yes, higher wages, doubling the rate of unionization in this country, making corporations and the wealthy pay their fair share, delivering healthcare and college affordability. But also offering a way to do these game changing transformations that will actually galvanize and energize, not polarize the American people. That is not only what we need in order to win, it\u2019s what we need in order to govern and actually get these things done."}, {"speaker": "George S.", "time": "13:31", "text": "Vice President Biden, how do you unify the country?"}, {"speaker": "Joe Biden", "time": "13:34", "text": "Look, Bernie says that you have to bring people together and we have to have Medicare for All. But Bernie says, and he says he wrote the damn thing, but he\u2019s unwilling to sell us with the damn thing\u2019s going to cost. The fact that we\u2019re in New Hampshire, very levelheaded group of people, look at the numbers. How much is it going to cost? Who\u2019s going to pay for it? It will cost more than the entire, the entire federal budget we spend now, more than entire budget. The idea middle class taxes aren\u2019t going to go up is just crazy. When they did it in Vermont, what happened? They doubled the state income tax and then had a 14% tax on withholding. And they finally did away with it. So how much is it going to cost? When you ask Bernie that, and I\u2019ll ask him again tonight sometime, and if you ask Bernie that, he says, \u201cGo figure, I don\u2019t know, we\u2019ll find out.\u201d"}, {"speaker": "Joe Biden", "time": "14:28", "text": "I think that was on CBS. He said, \u201d We\u2019ll find out.\u201d Or something to that effect. Imagine you\u2019re going to unite the country walking into the Congress, \u201cI got this bill. It\u2019s going to require Medicare for everybody. I can\u2019t tell you how much it\u2019s going to cost. We\u2019ll find out later and it\u2019s likely to be double whatever \u2026 everything we spent in the federal government.\u201d Who do you think is going to get that passed?

That\u2019s the status quo, Joe. That\u2019s what Health and Human Services says. [crosstalk 00:15:15] And what we have got to do Joe, and what we have got to do is understand, simple question, Joe, we are spending twice as much per capita on healthcare as do the people of any other country. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that the healthcare industry last year made $100 billion in profit. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that we are wasting $500 billion a year trying to administer thousands and thousands of different plans. What Medicare for All will do is save the average American substantial sums of money. Substantial, be much less expensive than your plan. And we will expand Medicare to include dental care, eyeglasses, hearing aides and home health care as well."}, {"speaker": "George S.", "time": "16:03", "text": "Vice President Biden, 30 second response, then Senator Klobuchar after that."}, {"speaker": "Joe Biden", "time": "16:07", "text": "30 second-"}, {"speaker": "George S.", "time": "16:09", "text": "Yeah, 30 second-"}, {"speaker": "Joe Biden", "time": "16:09", "text": "30 second response.

We\u2019re going to reduce drug prices, reduce prescription prices, reduce copays, et cetera. And it cost a lot of money, it costs $750 billion over 10 years. I tell you how I\u2019m going to pay for it. I\u2019m going to raise the capital gains rates, you pay capital gains and what your tax rate is. That\u2019ll pay for it, that\u2019s $800 billion.

And Pete, while you have a different plan now you sent out a tweet just a few years ago that said, henceforth, forewith, indubitably, affirmatively, you are for Medicare for All for the ages. And so I would like to point out that what leadership is about is taking a position, looking at things and sticking with them.

They walked out and then said, it\u2019s either that or groceries. It\u2019s that or pay them rent on time. We have got to change our healthcare system. The way [no audio or video 00:18:34] Help to the most people as quickly as we can. How about we start with what a president can do, I love saying this, all by herself.

If you want real change in healthcare, at the end of the day, you\u2019re going to have to take on the insurance companies, and tell them the function of healthcare is healthcare for all, not huge profits for the insurance companies. You\u2019re going to have to take on the drug companies, and their corruption, and their price fixing, and tell them, \u201cSorry, we\u2019re not going to pay 10 times more for prescription drugs, than do the people of other country.\u201d But at the end of the day, there\u2019s no way around it.

I watched my dad and I met many people here in this state and others, who go through the same thing where the father\u2019s made that longest walk or the mother\u2019s made that longest walk. I was listed for the entire time I was in the United States Congress as the poorest man in the United States Congress. My net worth was net zero a couple of times. The fact of the matter is that I\u2019ve never focused on money for me and I was a single dad for five years. It\u2019s not as hard as being a single mom and I had help from my sisters in the audience and others, but the fact is that I think we have to focus on what is at stake here."}, {"speaker": "Joe Biden", "time": "01:12:09", "text": "These aren\u2019t someone else\u2019s children.

A great number of them, as Mr. Yang said, aren\u2019t going on to college, although I think we should help with college. They\u2019re not going on to college. What they\u2019re going to do, they\u2019re going to be equipped to compete in the 21st century by training them for the new trades, the new opportunities, the new capabilities that are out there.

Same reason that we give tens of billions of dollars in subsidies and tax breaks to the fossil fuel industry, while half of our people are living paycheck to paycheck. The same reason that we have three people in America owning more wealth than the bottom half of America."}, {"speaker": "Bernie Sanders", "time": "01:13:59", "text": "The same reason that we are the only major country on earth not to guarantee healthcare to all people as a human right. Same reason as to why we are paying in some cases 10 times more than other countries for prescription drugs, and that reason is that our priorities are determined by the 1% and by wealthy campaign contributors. Our priorities are determined by those who want to see the rich get richer and are turning their backs on the working families of this country. What is unique about our campaign, is we say, unashamedly, we are raising our campaign contributions, not from billionaires but from working class people. That our campaign is about the working families of this country for the working class of this country and that is the administration that we will run. It is time to take on the big money interests.

We may have lost an election in 2016, Democrats, but we did not lose hope. And there is a way, it\u2019s actually based on a National Academy of Science report and I\u2019ve used that to put together a plan to reduce child poverty in half in 10 years and eradicate it in a generation. We can do it with investment in childcare. We can do it with investment in preschool and school and we can do it with tax credits and we can get it done.

It\u2019s to cut taxes on the richest Americans and the biggest corporations and then they pay for it by cutting education for kids, by cutting healthcare across the board, by allowing corporations to pollute as much as they want, and then they try and break unions and the organized labor movement. It\u2019s very simple. That\u2019s what Mr. Trump\u2019s plan is and it\u2019s true in every single red state, but we are not going to win by just criticizing Mr. Trump. I know that there is a better America out there and that America lives in our hearts and minds. And that America understands that when a kid succeeds in Columbia, South Carolina, that is a triumph for every American. And the same is true of a kid in Las Vegas, Nevada. Mr. Trump has no idea what prosperity looks like across this country. It\u2019s not just that he does bad things. He doesn\u2019t understand that investing in education and healthcare and good union jobs is actually an investment in our common humanity and in growth in the future, mobility and justice. That is the America that lives in our hearts and minds that will beat Mr. Trump, because he will never be able to imagine it. So in fact, what we need to do is have a new conception, a new dream of America, dream it and make it happen. Imagine the mountain and then we climb it together. We are in perilous times.
