We don\u2019t have a moment to waste in combating the climate crisis. It\u2019s an existential threat to us. In short, we need to build a fair, more inclusive and more resilient America. And with that in mind, I\u2019d like to welcome to this conversation a leader who shares those values and has been an outspoken advocate for that vision for a long time. My friend, Senator Bernie Sanders. Bernie, welcome."}, {"speaker": "Bernie Sanders", "time": "03:55", "text": "Joe, thank you very much for your remarks and thank you for welcoming me to your livestream here. As you\u2019ve indicated, we are living in an unbelievably unprecedented moment. You and I were chatting a few months ago, not in a million years would we have believed that we would be talking to each other in our respective homes, that we could not do rallies, that we could not get out of the house. We would not have believed that we\u2019d be looking not only at a pandemic, which as you indicated has taken over 20,000 lives in our country. Half a million people infected but has cost us 16 million jobs and that\u2019s probably a conservative number. The real number is probably higher than that. So, we are in a terrible moment, an unprecedented moment. And I know we share the understanding that we\u2019ve got to go forward right now and out of this in an unprecedented way to address the terrible pain that so many of our fellow Americans are feeling."}, {"speaker": "Bernie Sanders", "time": "05:07", "text": "So today I am asking all Americans, I\u2019m asking every Democrat, I\u2019m asking every independent, I\u2019m asking a lot of Republicans to come together in this campaign to support your candidacy, which I endorse to make certain that we defeat somebody who I believe, and I\u2019m just speaking just for myself now, is the most dangerous president in the modern history of this country. A president, and you made this point who downplayed this pandemic, who ignored the advice that some of his people were giving him, who has not used the Defense Production Act early on so that we could produce the masks, the gowns, the gloves, the ventilators that our medical personnel desperately need. Who today, because I understand that he is threatening to fire Dr. Fauci, who has been an unbelievable, I mean it is\u2026 Who has been day after day, the voice of science to the American people trying to explain how we go forward in this crisis and he\u2019s threatening to fire him."}, {"speaker": "Bernie Sanders", "time": "06:20", "text": "So to me, for all of those reasons and so many more, a president who doesn\u2019t apparently has never read the constitution of the United States who believes he\u2019s above the law. A president who lies all of the time, a president who has at least shown me that he is a racist and a sexist and a homophobe and a xenophobe and a religious bigot. I mean, for all of those reasons or more, we\u2019ve got to make Trump a one term president and we need you in the White House. So I will do all that I can to see that happens, Joe. And I know that there is an enormous responsibility on your shoulders right now and it\u2019s imperative that all of us work together to do what has to be done not only in this moment but beyond this moment in the future of this country."}, {"speaker": "Bernie Sanders", "time": "07:13", "text": "And in that regard I have been very pleased that your staff and my staff have been working together over the last several weeks to coming up with a number of task forces. These are task forces that will look at some of the most important issues facing this country, the economy, how we create an economy that works for all, not just a few. Education, how we create the best educational system in the world for all of our people. How we deal with climate change, which as you indicated is an existential threat to the planet. How we deal with criminal justice because we don\u2019t want to continue having more people in jail than any other country on earth. How we deal with immigration reform and how we have a healthcare system that is so much better than what we have right now. Now, it\u2019s no great secret out there, Joe, that you and I have our differences and we\u2019re not going to paper them over. That\u2019s real. But I hope that these task forces will come together utilizing the best minds and people in your campaign and in my campaign to work out real solutions to these very, very important problems. So look forward to working with you and bringing some great people into those task forces."}, {"speaker": "Joe Biden", "time": "08:46", "text": "Well, Bernie I want to thank you for that. It\u2019s a big deal. And I think that your endorsement means a great deal. It means a great deal to me. I think people are going to be surprised that we are apart on some issues, but we\u2019re awfully close to on a whole bunch of others. And, and I think you\u2019ve made\u2026 If I am the nominee, which looks like now you just made me, I\u2019m going to need you not just to win the campaign but to govern. And so did you have any questions for me, Bernie at all?"}, {"speaker": "Bernie Sanders", "time": "09:26", "text": "I did Joe. Just let\u2019s talk about some of the areas that I think we are actually fairly close. There are some areas where we disagree, but somewhere we are fairly close. Let\u2019s talk about the economy and above and beyond the crisis that we\u2019re in right now, you know very well that millions of our people are working for starvation wages. And one of the fights that I\u2019ve been waging for a number of years now is to raise that minimum wage to at least 15 bucks an hour.

But look, it means a great deal to me personally, as I said in my statement, when you suspended your campaign, I want to thank you for being the powerful voice and you\u2019ve been the most powerful voice for a fair and more just America. It\u2019s a voice like yours that refuses to allow us just to accept what is. You\u2019ve refused to accept that we can\u2019t change what\u2019s wrong in our nation. You refused to accept that health and wellbeing of our fellow citizens and our planet is the responsibility of somebody else. It\u2019s our responsibility [inaudible 00:10:41] and you don\u2019t get enough credit, Bernie, for being the voice that forces us to take a hard look in the mirror and ask ourselves, \u201cHave we done enough,\u201d and we haven\u2019t."}, {"speaker": "Joe Biden", "time": "10:51", "text": "One issue you\u2019ve led in the past is making sure that every single solitary thing we can do to keep workers whole during this crisis is a part of it. It goes well beyond the $15 an hour, as I said, more than 16 million, and you\u2019re right, it\u2019s probably significantly more than 16 million Americans have lost their jobs because that\u2019s a lagging indicator. And Congress has appropriated more than $2.2 trillion in this last round of so called CARES Act. And my concern is the Trump administration is going to continue to do what it\u2019s always done and that is, it\u2019s going to make sure the response in a way that the structural benefits go to the wealthy and the well-connected. And that\u2019s been your cry for a long time, Bernie. Basically, they\u2019re helping their friends. It isn\u2019t about the legislation, the legislation\u2019s been good, it\u2019s about how it\u2019s being implemented. The biggest, best connected firms are getting assistance as fast as they can ask for it. Oversight and few conditions from Treasury and the Fed had been sort of wiped away. We should be imposing much stricter conditions on these big firms. Tell them they only get the relief if they keep workers on their payroll, keep their jobs, make a commitment they won\u2019t buy back their stock, pay out dividends, enrich their executives."}, {"speaker": "Joe Biden", "time": "12:06", "text": "In fact, Donald Trump and his team are trying to gut the whole oversight of the Corporate Loan Program now. Trump fired the Inspector General \u2026 I know you know this \u2026 who was put in place to police corporate corruption and what\u2019s he trying to hide? Congress should demand answers and I know you will. Meanwhile, the little guy, the mom and pop shops, the men and women and minority owned businesses, they\u2019re have the fewest resources to fall back on in this crisis and they\u2019re facing obstacles and delays the threaten their very existence of their businesses. And but no one in Donald Trump\u2019s White House or Treasury is taking the kind of bold action required to make sure that those without prior wealth, without prior wealth or prior connections get a priority."}, {"speaker": "Joe Biden", "time": "12:51", "text": "We should insist that the Trump White House and the Treasury Department move more aggressively to get those grants and loans to small businesses now when they really need it. And if the banks won\u2019t do it, to go back to your point, they won\u2019t process the loans for small business regardless of their size, then the Federal Government should use their wartime authority to compel them to do so because otherwise in six months we\u2019re going to look back and see this crisis has only made inequity worse in America."}, {"speaker": "Joe Biden", "time": "13:21", "text": "And I\u2019ve said it from the beginning of our conversation, we just can\u2019t think about building back to the way things were before.

Among many of the provisions we put it in there wasn\u2019t my first priority by any means, $450 billion for large corporations. So a lot of money and what Trump now wants to do is to spend that money without telling us who gets it."}, {"speaker": "Joe Biden", "time": "14:26", "text": "Exactly."}, {"speaker": "Bernie Sanders", "time": "14:26", "text": "Can you believe that?

But we need, as you indicated, absolute transparency."}, {"speaker": "Bernie Sanders", "time": "14:47", "text": "The other thing Joe, I think we have to deal with right now is with so many folks unemployed and underemployed, we\u2019ve got to make sure that the government comes up with a continued set up policies that protect those workers. And the pain all over the country is now horrific. You have seen, as I have, these lines of cars of people in the United States of America, of folks who have just lost their jobs, who have no food in the pantry, they are lining up to get food."}, {"speaker": "Bernie Sanders", "time": "15:23", "text": "So we\u2019ve got to do everything that we can as rapidly as we can to make sure that nobody in America goes hungry, that nobody in America during this crisis, in my view, lacks healthcare, that nobody in America in this crisis is evicted from their homes, evicted from their apartments, loses their homes. There\u2019s an enormous amount of work that has to be done to protect workers in this country, in this crisis right now."}, {"speaker": "Bernie Sanders", "time": "15:50", "text": "But the question you ask as I understand it, is where do we go from here?

This country wasn\u2019t built by Wall Street. It wasn\u2019t built by CEOs and hedge fund managers. It was built by workers. The great American middle class was built by American labor unions. Unions, and yes, unions, that\u2019s the story of America. Ordinary people from the neighborhoods you and I grew up in doing extraordinary things given half a chance. Millions of people all across this nation who get up every day and go to work, raise their families, pay their taxes, volunteer in their communities and make this country work. We\u2019re watching them, they\u2019re the people making it work now. And people understand that being middle class isn\u2019t a number, it\u2019s a value set. It\u2019s about being able to own your own home and not have to rent it, if that\u2019s what you choose."}, {"speaker": "Joe Biden", "time": "17:12", "text": "It\u2019s about being able to live in a neighborhood where you can send your kids to the park and they\u2019re going to come home safely. Or being able to send your kids to a good high school or good school, public school, where they\u2019ll do well enough that they can go on to trade school or college or community college, whatever suits them well. And it\u2019s about being able to take care, take care of your geriatric mom when your dad passes, or about being able to put money aside so your kids won\u2019t have to take care of you when you haven\u2019t been able to save for retirement."}, {"speaker": "Joe Biden", "time": "17:44", "text": "And at the turn of the 20th Century, our labor movement built the middle class out of factory workers, and now two decades later, the 21st Century, our labor moment is trying to build that by including not just factory workers, but service workers too. Healthcare and home care workers, you\u2019ve been fighting for them for a long time. Childcare workers, janitors, garbage truck drivers, grocery store clerks, fast food workers. In short, people on the front lines of this crisis."}, {"speaker": "Joe Biden", "time": "18:15", "text": "Here\u2019s what I\u2019m hoping, Bernie. I\u2019m hoping that the American people are going to get a fresh look at really who makes the country run. I really mean it. We\u2019re seeing the country restore \u2026 it\u2019s the soul of America, we\u2019re seeing a little bit of it. These people coming forward doing extraordinary things when they don\u2019t have to. And I want Donald Trump to look at these people in the eye and tell them after they put their lives on the line for the rest of us, that they don\u2019t deserve a living wage, that they don\u2019t deserve healthcare, that they don\u2019t deserve to be able to send their kids to college or community college or trade school, that they don\u2019t deserve to make equal pay for equal work."}, {"speaker": "Joe Biden", "time": "18:50", "text": "I want him to look them in the eye and tell them that they don\u2019t deserve to be able to organize, to fight for what they deserve, to bargain with dignity, to demand their employers give them their due. I want him to look them in the eye and tell them that the scientists are wrong, that climate change is not an existential crisis demanding worldwide domestic and international responses. And I want him to tell all the moms and dads across the country that their children and grandchildren don\u2019t have the right to clean air and water."}, {"speaker": "Joe Biden", "time": "19:22", "text": "Look, the United States has no choice but to seize this opportunity and create millions, millions of great paying jobs that your Energy Plan has suggested and mine as well. An energy infrastructure of tomorrow, not going back to anything that was before. Tomorrow. And we take a back seat to no one when it comes to fighting climate change or when it comes to creating good paying jobs, middle-class jobs, union jobs. I led the Recovery Act, which was the single greatest investment in clean energy in American history. We could do more, we should do more. As President, I\u2019ll put pipe fitters, iron workers, steel workers, electricians, and other trades to building the infrastructure over the clean energy future. American workers should build American infrastructure and-"}, {"speaker": "Joe Biden", "time": "20:03", "text": "Future. American workers should build American infrastructure and manufacturer all the materials that go into it, and all the workers must have an option to join a union.

And Bernie, you and I have spent our careers fighting for these folks, and I look forward to working with you.

And you and I both know it\u2019s not folks who our age and just younger. It\u2019s generation Z. People in their teens in their 20s. These are the people who are going to begin their careers, people working their way through college or trade school. They\u2019re going to have student loans. They\u2019re going to come into the economy, an economy in turmoil. We\u2019re going to be worse than we are. The predictions are it\u2019s going to be like Roosevelt, what he faced and worse. We saw it with the millennials after the 2008 crash. They\u2019re still struggling to catch up. So what politics and what policies do we need to address for the concerns of these young people? Because I do think they\u2019ve been put behind the eight ball more than our generation was or any generation in recent history."}, {"speaker": "Bernie Sanders", "time": "21:28", "text": "Oh, that\u2019s absolutely true, Joe. And I\u2019m glad you\u2019re prepared to focus on that issue. It\u2019s the right thing to do. And that is a generation of young people who are experiencing crisis after crisis. So let me start off by saying that in my view, if we believe in a strong democracy, which you do and I do. We have actually read the Constitution of the United States unlike the current president. If we understand that in a competitive global economy, we\u2019re going to need the best educated workforce in the world. I think you understand and I understand that free public education has got to go beyond 12th grade right now, that we need to make public colleges and universities tuition free and that we have to move very aggressively."}, {"speaker": "Bernie Sanders", "time": "22:18", "text": "The dealing with the reality that so many of our people, young and not so young, are struggling with this outrageous level of student debt.

We\u2019re now paying it off. Now he went to a private university but still paying off his loan. My daughter is still paying off her loans and look, we need to think about what we can do to address these concerns. Look, you\u2019ve been a leader on the student debt issue and affordability of higher education. I\u2019ve been saying for a long time, you\u2019ve probably heard me say in the past, one of the reasons why we jumped ahead and stay \u2026 One of the reasons why we jumped ahead of the rest of the world back in the turn of the 20th century, we were the first nation in the world to come along and say, \u201cWe have universal education for 12 years.\u201d If it hadn\u2019t been done and we were just doing it for the first time in 2020 would anybody think 12 years is enough to be able to compete in the 21st century?"}, {"speaker": "Joe Biden", "time": "23:36", "text": "I think not, but one of the things that I\u2019ve changed my mind on, I propose to forgive debt for low income and middle-class individuals for community colleges and the like, but here\u2019s the deal. If you\u2019re attending a public university, college university, as well as a private HBCU historic black college or minority serving institutions, I\u2019ve already called for immediate canceling of a minimum of $10,000 of their student loan debt now under this crisis and allow them to borrow so they can cope with this crisis. Look, I proposed and aggressively canceling student debt for those who were abused and misled by private for profit colleges. So have you. You\u2019re way ahead. And those are folks with some of the highest debt burdens. As I\u2019ve said earlier, as we deal with the immediate crisis response, we can\u2019t lose sight of the longer term. When we come out of this, we can\u2019t just go back to business as usual. We need to build a better, stronger foundation for America. In 2021 our whole country will have to take a hard look and ask how do we fix what\u2019s deeply broken?"}, {"speaker": "Joe Biden", "time": "24:48", "text": "Here\u2019s my pledge. I will make an educator an education that in fact, Jill, my wife is a professor at a community college, says any country that out competes us, Joe, out educates is going to out compete us and so we\u2019ll make education or community college free for all. And here\u2019s the thing that has changed with this crisis. At our public colleges and universities make them free for all lower income and middle class families and middle class families. Because look, they\u2019re going to face an enormous burden. Where are they going to get the money to go even to our state universities or borrow that money? We have to lower the cost of private historic black colleges universities, and minority serving institutions as well and ease the burden of student debt.

We got to build a green, resilient, sustainable infrastructure that will power generations of inclusive growth while saving our planet. Look, and we\u2019re going to confront income and equity in this nation, build a social safety net that gives all Americans the dignity and security they deserve. And we\u2019re going to make sure health care, and this is your signature issue, is made affordable and accessible to every American and build a public health system that can prevent future pandemics. I want to talk to you about this. I really think we should be thinking about having a new office, a new cabinet office, on pandemics in the United States, but that\u2019s another issue."}, {"speaker": "Joe Biden", "time": "26:43", "text": "But we\u2019re going to finally achieve comprehensive immigration reform as well putting millions of citizens on a pathway to citizenship, including so many who are on the front lines right now.

One of the things I had the greatest pleasure of doing when I was vice president is going to one of Sadam Hussein\u2019s, on of my multiple visits to Iraq, and swearing in well over, I think it was 180 undocumented people who were joined the United States military. They had won bronze stars, silver stars. They had purple hearts. These are people who have demonstrated, they\u2019re prepared, they\u2019re in a sense many are more Americans than a lot of Americans. We\u2019re going to address this structural racism in our country as well.

I believe there\u2019s a great opportunity, a great opportunity to work together to deploy policy approaches that can take us closer to our shared goals. So I\u2019m pleased to announce that Bernie and I have agreed to establish, as we said, we already talked about it, six policy working groups, one on the economy, one on education, one on criminal justice. It should be reform, not punishment. One on immigration, climate change and the economy. These groups are made up of thoughtful leaders that will work with Bernie and some of whom have supported me as well.

We\u2019ve disagreed but we\u2019ve been friends.

We should not have more people in jail than any other country, disproportionately African American and Latino."}, {"speaker": "Bernie Sanders", "time": "30:32", "text": "You made the point about undocumented workers. The ugly irony is those people today in America are putting their lives on the line, and you know what? They\u2019re not even eligible for the benefits that we have appropriated in the Senate. Imagine that. They can\u2019t get that $1,200 check. They can\u2019t get unemployment. So we got a lot of work to do to make this country the kind of nation that I know you want to see, that I want to see and the vast majority of the American people want to see."}, {"speaker": "Bernie Sanders", "time": "31:03", "text": "We got to deal with incoming wealth inequality. We\u2019ve got to deal with a healthcare system that is broken in so many ways. You mentioned the issue of climate change. Man, we don\u2019t have a choice there. Future of the planet determines, demands that we are bold in transforming our energy system. And as you\u2019ve indicated, we can create millions of jobs doing that."}, {"speaker": "Bernie Sanders", "time": "31:27", "text": "So there\u2019s a lot of work to do. Let\u2019s go forward together in doing that. And I know you are the kind of guy who is going to be inclusive. You want to bring people in, even people who disagree with you. You want to hear what they have to say. We can argue it out. It\u2019s called democracy. You believe in democracy. So do I. Let\u2019s respect each other. Let\u2019s address the challenges we face right now and in the future. And in that regard, Joe, I very much look forward to working with you."}, {"speaker": "Joe Biden", "time": "31:55", "text": "Well, Bernie, thank you. And look, one of the things that I think as a student of history, as you are, American history, out of every crisis Americans faced from the Civil War straight through to today, we have come out of it stronger. We\u2019ve come out of it and fixed things that were institutionally, structurally wrong beforehand. We haven\u2019t fixed them all. But look what happened with the Great Depression. We got everything from social security to right\u2026 a whole range of things."}, {"speaker": "Joe Biden", "time": "32:24", "text": "Well, this is a time, and I think what\u2019s happened is the American public have seen, as I said earlier, I\u2019ve said it may be a million times, I\u2019m going to say a million and one, kind of rip the bandaid off, exposed how the substructure of this economy is so, so damaged by what\u2019s going on. And the idea we\u2019re still arguing about whether healthcare is a right is bizarre. The idea that we continue to think that the way to deal with the criminal justice system now that we\u2019ve known so much and learned so much is to punish instead of rehabilitate. The idea we put someone in jail for a drug abuse, and we don\u2019t put them in a mandatory rehabilitation as opposed to prison. The idea, we have people in prison who can\u2019t read and don\u2019t have any skill that we don\u2019t train them so when they get out, you don\u2019t give them a bus ticket and 25 bucks and put them underneath a bridge."}, {"speaker": "Joe Biden", "time": "33:19", "text": "But I\u2019d like to close by saying, Bernie, as Jill and I told you and Jane, we\u2019re deeply grateful to both of you. You\u2019ve put the interest of this nation and the need to beat Donald Trump above all else. And for that, Jill and I are grateful. And we know we have enormous responsibility to meet that expectation."}, {"speaker": "Joe Biden", "time": "33:40", "text": "We also want you to know, I\u2019m excited to do the work with you in the months and years ahead. As you say, not me, us. Not me, us. That\u2019s your phrase, pal. And your supporters and I are going to make the same commitment. I see you. I tell your supporters, I see you. I hear you. I understand the urgency of what it is that we have to get done in this country. And I hope you\u2019ll join us. The more, the merrier. We need to come together. We need to defeat Donald Trump."}, {"speaker": "Joe Biden", "time": "34:12", "text": "As I\u2019ve said for a long time, when we do that, we\u2019ll not only do the hard work of rebuilding this nation, we can transform this nation. We can transform it so that it goes down in history with your help, Bernie, as one of the most progressive administrations since Roosevelt. And I really believe, I think it\u2019s doable because the whole world has changed. It\u2019s not just us. The whole world has changed. We\u2019re in the middle of a fourth industrial revolution. The question is, will there be a middle class left based on all that\u2019s happening? We have to address it. It\u2019s not just our concern. If we, the wealthiest country in the world, can\u2019t address it and provide more equity and opportunity, we\u2019re going to continue to see the kind of shifts you see in Europe."}, {"speaker": "Joe Biden", "time": "34:58", "text": "So anyway, I\u2019m looking forward to working with you, pal. I really genuinely mean it from the bottom of my heart. Thank you for being such a gentlemen. Thank you for being so generous. And I give you my word. I\u2019ll try my best not to let you all down."}, {"speaker": "Bernie Sanders", "time": "35:11", "text": "Thank you very much, Joe."}, {"speaker": "Joe Biden", "time": "35:12", "text": "Thanks, pal."}, {"speaker": "Bernie Sanders", "time": "35:13", "text": "Jane and I say hello to Jill as well."}, {"speaker": "Joe Biden", "time": "35:16", "text": "I will."}]}]}
