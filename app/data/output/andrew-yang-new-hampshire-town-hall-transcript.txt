We eliminated 4 million manufacturing jobs in this country over the last number of years. And where were those jobs primarily located? Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Missouri, Iowa. All of the swing states that Donald Trump needed to win and did win. The same thing happened here in New Hampshire a bit earlier. You all lost over 12,000 manufacturing jobs, primarily in the northern part of the state, a bit before the rust belt started to lose theirs. And if you\u2019ve been to those towns in the northern part of New Hampshire, you know that after the plant or a mill closed, the shopping district closed, people left, the school shrank, and that town has never recovered. I saw the same thing play out in Missouri, Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, during my seven years running Venture for America. And what happened to those manufacturing jobs is now shifting to other parts of the economy. How many of you have noticed stores closing around where you live in New Hampshire? And why are those stores closing?"}, {"speaker": "Andrew Yang", "time": "03:03", "text": "Amazon primarily.

I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve seen the stories, but the fulfillment centers, they have all of these machines doing work and then they have humans doing work too, but the humans have bracelets on that chirp at them if they don\u2019t work hard enough in any given five minute period."}, {"speaker": "Andrew Yang", "time": "04:03", "text": "I don\u2019t know if you know this.

The reality is that almost half of the manufacturing workers in the Midwest who lost their jobs left the workforce and did not work again. Of that group, almost half filed for disability. We then saw surges in suicides and drug overdoses in these communities, to the point where America\u2019s life expectancy declined for three years in a row.

It ordinarily just goes up because you\u2019re getting richer, stronger, and healthier. But here it went down and then down and then down again.

I mean, if you\u2019re us, you care about life expectancy because it\u2019s literally our lives, but if you\u2019re DC, you just follow the money. Washington, DC today is the richest city in our country. Think about that for a second. What do they produce? None of us knows, but business seems awfully good. Donald Trump said he wanted to drain the swamp. Portsmouth, I want to do something a little bit different. I want to distribute the swamp.

The biggest issue is the lobbyist cash and the corporate interests that have overrun our government for years and decades. I\u2019m going to tell a New Hampshire story. A friend of mine from Exeter went to work on Capitol Hill. He\u2019s a good man, went with the best of intentions, and he told me he would never become a lobbyist.

That\u2019s what\u2019s really going on in our government today. If you have money on one side and people on the other, the money\u2019s going to win. So how do we solve this problem? Democrats will talk about overturning Citizens United, which is correct. We should try and get dark money out of politics. But it would take a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United, and corporate money ran our government even before that ruling. It\u2019s not like everything was great and then that ruling came and it\u2019s like, \u201cOh no, now it went bad.\u201d So what we have to do is unite the people and the money. Now, how do we do that? Right now, only 5% of Americans donate to political candidates or campaigns. So if you\u2019re in that 5%, pat yourself on the back, you\u2019re one of the most politically engaged Americans in the country. My proposal is we give every American voter a hundred democracy dollars you can give to any candidate or campaign you want every year, use it or lose it."}, {"speaker": "Andrew Yang", "time": "13:37", "text": "What percentage of Americans do you think would make a donation then, if you had a hundred free dollars to use?"}, {"speaker": "Audience Members", "time": "13:41", "text": "[inaudible 00:13:46]."}, {"speaker": "Andrew Yang", "time": "13:45", "text": "That\u2019s a little low. Let\u2019s say it\u2019s 40% or 50%. it\u2019s certainly not going to be 100%. you can\u2019t get 100% of Americans do anything. Some of them would be like, \u201cI don\u2019t like this plan.\u201d But if you got it up to 40% or 50% you would wash out the lobbyist cash by a factor of four to one. Because imagine if you had 10,000 Americans give you their hundred democracy dollars, that\u2019s $1 million. And then when the lobbyist comes over and says, \u201cHey, I\u2019ve got $80,000 for you,\u201d you\u2019re like, \u201cI don\u2019t want to touch your $80,000 because they\u2019re going to notice and they\u2019re backing me and I\u2019d much rather get the money from them.\u201d So this is how we unite the people and the money, actually bring them together and flush out the lobbyist cash that\u2019s overrun the government. These are changes that need to start at the top.

As soon as you show up as a regulator in government, some company\u2019s there with a giant bag of money saying, \u201cHey, I will give you all this money after you leave your post, and by the way, go easy on us.\u201d And then that\u2019s their incentives. They\u2019re like, \u201cAll right.\u201d You know who actually just came out and said this? Sheila Bair, who was a banking regulator in DC, she said, \u201cLook, all of my incentives are to go easy on the company.

That\u2019s the only way we\u2019re actually going to get government working for us again. Even more important, and I know that sounds like that is the number one thing, but even more important than getting government working for the people is getting this economy working for more of us and our families.

Milton Friedman, the patron saint of libertarianism, and a thousand economists endorsed this plan. It\u2019s the first time Milton has actually just gotten a round of applause, but I mean, I\u2019ll take it. I mean, I do cite him for a reason.
