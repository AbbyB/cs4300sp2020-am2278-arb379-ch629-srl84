With thousands of hardworking American patriots who love our country, cherish our values, respect our laws and always put America first. Eight months from now, we\u2019re going to defeat the radical socialists. We\u2019re going to win the great state of North Carolina in a landslide.

And there\u2019s not a lot of enthusiasm for Biden. I thought he gave up the presidency the other day because he said he\u2019s running for the Senate.

We went out, we\u2019re doing everything in our power to keep the sick and infected people from coming into our country. We\u2019re working on that very hard. We closed our borders very early. I took a lot of heat for that. Remember when I closed the borders to certain areas of the world? I took a lot of heat. But there are fringe globalists who would rather keep our borders open than keep our infection, think of it, keep all of the infection, let it come in. And we\u2019re working with other countries. In all fairness, look, it\u2019s a problem, we\u2019re working with other countries. Remember this, over the last long period of time, the flu, the common flu, you know this, right? From 27,000 to 70,000 people get infected, and many people die. Think of it, 27,000. You lose 27,000 people to the common flu. It can be much more. One year was much higher than the 70,000 number. Those people died. So when you lose 27,000 people a year, nobody knew that. I didn\u2019t know that. Three, four weeks ago, I was sitting there, I said, \u201cWhat do we lose with the regular flu?\u201d They said, \u201cAbout 27,000 minimum, goes up to 70, sometimes even 80, one year it went up to 100,000 people.\u201d I said, \u201cNobody told me that.

Washington Democrats are trying to politicize the coronavirus, denigrating the noble work of our public health professionals. But honestly, not so much anymore. Everyone appreciates, these are the greatest professionals in the world at what they do. We\u2019re actually helping a lot of other countries where they have some very, very big problems. So we have our professionals in constant touch, I\u2019m in constant touch with some of the leaders and helping them out. But the political attacks from some of the Democrats really must stop.

And we learned a lot, and maybe that had the impact on the stock market. Who knows what happened, but we\u2019re going to reduce and the severity of what\u2019s happening, the duration of the virus.
