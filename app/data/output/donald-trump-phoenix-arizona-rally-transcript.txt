The great, great, great state of Ohio. Remember? Remember, they used to say a year before the election, they said, \u201cWell, nobody can win. Nobody, unless you win the great state of Ohio.\u201d And we won the great state of Ohio, and we won it big. We knew we were going to win it. And now we\u2019re up a lot more than we were up even then, because you know why? We\u2019re bringing back jobs. We\u2019re bringing back factories. Everybody\u2019s working.

So what happens is this, we\u2019re working on healthcare. We\u2019re fighting to stop surprise medical billing. I just signed an executive order imposing price transparency because when providers are required to show their prices, those same prices fall very fast. We\u2019ve approved a record number of affordable new generic drugs, which are just as good as the brand drugs, but they cost a tiny fraction. We\u2019ve totally transformed veteran\u2019s healthcare, including getting long-sought VA choice and VA accountability, which they said could not be done. And we passed the spectacular right to try. So if you\u2019re in trouble, and I hope nobody in this massive arena\u2019s in trouble, but if you\u2019re in trouble, you can go and get whatever the new drug or whatever where we have the best doctors, best hospital, best labs. You get it. And the luck we are having, we are saving so many lives. It\u2019s incredible what\u2019s happening. People would go to Europe. They\u2019d go to Asia. If they had no money, they\u2019d go home and die. Now they have the right to use our drugs before they\u2019re approved. Think of that. Before they\u2019re approved.

That is why in my State of the Union, I asked Congress to prohibit late-term abortion of babies because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God.
