I believe that there is a consensus in this country. A consensus that said we need to strengthen and expand instant background checks, do away with his gun show loophole that we have to address the issue of mental health, that we have to deal with the straw man purchasing issue and that when we develop that consensus, we can finally do something to address this crisis."

The second was the Arab Spring, which created huge vacuums in Libya and in Syria that allowed terrorist movements to move in there. The third was the recent deal allowing Iran to move forward and eventually acquire a nuclear weapon, which sent bad signal, bad body language into the region about whether we are acquiescing in Iran becoming a stronger piece of the formula in that part of the world."

There is an agenda there that we need to be following up on. Similarly, we need to tackle mass incarceration, and this may be the only bi- partisan issue in the congress this year. We actually have people on both sides of the aisle who have reached the same conclusion, that we can not keep imprisoning more people than anybody else in the world, but, I believe that the debate, and the discussion has to go further, Anderson, because we\u2019ve got to do more about the lives of these children.

As a young student in Nevada said to me, the hardest thing about going to college should not be paying for it, so then we have to make it more affordable. How do we make it more affordable? My plan would enable anyone to go to a public college or university tuition free. You would not have to borrow money for tuition. But I do believe, and maybe it\u2019s because I worked when I went through college, I worked when I went through law school, I think it\u2019s important for everybody to have some part of getting this accomplished.

What we did is pass a $15 billion dollar piece of legislation which brought in many, many new doctors, and nurses into the V.A. so that veterans in this country could get the health care when they needed it, and not be on long waiting lines. The other part of that legislation said that if a veteran is living more than 40 miles away from a V.A. facility, that veteran could get health care from the community health center, or the private sector. As a result of that legislation, we went further in than any time in recent history in improving health care for the men and women of this country who put their lives on the line to defend them."

And what I\u2019m most proud of is my judgment, particularly in the Iraq war vote. There was a lot of pressure, political pressure, public pressure.

They all seem to happen during campaigns, and then once the election\u2019s over people start from scratch again and try to get things done. One of the things I can promise you, if you look at my record, in and out of government, is that I\u2019ve always been willing to take on a complicated, sometimes unpopular, issues and work them through, the complex issues, and work them through in order to have a solution. We did it with criminal justice reform. We\u2019ve had a lot of discussion here about criminal justice reform. We did it in other ways. We need a national political strategy for our economy, for our foreign policy, for social justice, and, by the way, for how you run and manage the most complex bureaucracy in the world, which is the federal government. I know how to lead. I did it in Vietnam, I did it in the Pentagon, I did it in the Senate, and if you will help me overcome this cavalcade of financial irregularities and money that is poisoning our political process, I am ready to do that for you in the White House."

I truly believe that we are standing on the threshold of a new era of American progress. Unless you\u2019ve become discouraged about our gridlock in Congress, talk to our young people under 30, because you\u2019ll never find among them people that want to bash immigrants or people that want to deny rights to gay couples. That tells me we are moving to a more connected, generous, and compassionate place, and we need to speak to the goodness within our country."
