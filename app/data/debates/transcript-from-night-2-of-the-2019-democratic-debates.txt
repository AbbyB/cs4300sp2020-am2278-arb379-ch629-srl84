In a recent interview you said you suspected that Americans would be \u201cdelighted\u201d to pay more taxes for things like that. My question to you is, will taxes go up for the middle class in a Sanders administration, and if so, how do you sell that to voters?"}, {"speaker": "Bernie Sanders", "time": "00:24", "text": "Okay. Well, you\u2019re quite right. We have a new vision for America. And at a time when we have three people in this country owning more wealth than the bottom half of America, while 500,000 people are sleeping out on the streets today, we think it is time for change, real change. And by that I mean that healthcare, in my view, is a human right and we have got to pass a Medicare for All, single payer system."}, {"speaker": "Bernie Sanders", "time": "00:55", "text": "Under that system, by the way, vast majority of the people in this country will be paying significantly less for healthcare than they are right now."}, {"speaker": "Bernie Sanders", "time": "01:06", "text": "I believe that education is the future for this country, and that is why I believe that we must make public colleges and universities tuition free and eliminate student debt, and we do that by placing a tax on Wall Street."}, {"speaker": "Bernie Sanders", "time": "01:25", "text": "Every proposal that I have brought forth is fully paid for."}, {"speaker": "Savanagh G.", "time": "01:30", "text": "Senator Sanders, I\u2019ll give you 10 seconds just to answer the very direct question. Will you raise taxes for the middle class in a Sanders administration?"}, {"speaker": "Bernie Sanders", "time": "01:39", "text": "People who have healthcare on the Medicare for All will have no premiums, no deductibles, no co-payments, no out-of-pocket expenses.

Recently in remarks to a group of wealthy donors, as you were speaking about the problem of income inequality in this country, you said we shouldn\u2019t \u201cdemonize the rich.\u201d You said nobody has to be punished, no one\u2019s standard of living would change, nothing would fundamentally change. What did you mean by that?"}, {"speaker": "Joe Biden", "time": "02:27", "text": "What I meant by that is, look, Donald Trump thinks Wall Street built America. Ordinary middle class Americans built American. My dad used to have an expression. He said, \u201cJoe, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It\u2019s about your dignity. It\u2019s about respect.

What I\u2019m saying is that we\u2019ve got to be straight forward. We have to make sure we understand that to return dignity to the middle class, they have to have insurance that is covered and they can afford it. They have to make sure that we are in a situation where there\u2019s continuing education and they\u2019re able to pay for it, and they have to make sure that they\u2019re able to breathe air that is clean and they have water that they can drink."}, {"speaker": "Joe Biden", "time": "03:12", "text": "Look, Donald Trump has put us in a horrible situation, we do have enormous income inequality.

Do you think that Democrats have a responsibility to explain how they will pay for every proposal they make along those lines?"}, {"speaker": "Kamala Harris", "time": "03:52", "text": "Well, let me tell you something. I hear that question, but where was that question when the Republicans and Donald Trump passed a tax bill that benefits the top 1%, and the biggest corporations in this country, contributing at least $1 trillion to the debt of America, which middle class families will pay for one way or another."}, {"speaker": "Kamala Harris", "time": "04:12", "text": "Working families need support and need to be lifted up, and frankly, this economy is not working for working people. For too long, the rules have been written in the favor of the people who have the most, and not in favor of the people who work the most, which is why I am proposing that we change the tax code."}, {"speaker": "Kamala Harris", "time": "04:31", "text": "So for every family that is making less than $100,000 a year, they will receive a tax credit that they can collect $500 a month, which will make all the difference between those families being able to get through the end of the month with dignity and with support, or not.

You\u2019ve warned that Democrats will lose in 2020 if they embrace socialism, as you put it. You were booed at the California Democratic Convention when you said that. Only one candidate on this stage, Senator Sanders, identifies himself as a Democratic socialist. What are the policies or positions of your opponents that you think are veering towards socialism?"}, {"speaker": "John H.", "time": "05:18", "text": "Well, I think that the bottom line is if we don\u2019t clearly define that we are not socialists, the Republicans are going to come at us every way they can and call us socialists, and if you look at the Green New Deal, which I admire the sense of urgency and how important it is to do climate change, I\u2019m a scientist, but we can\u2019t promise every American a government job. If you want to get universal healthcare coverage, I believe that healthcare is a right and not a privilege, but you can\u2019t expect to eliminate private insurance for 180 million people, many of whom don\u2019t want to give it up."}, {"speaker": "John H.", "time": "05:51", "text": "In Colorado, we brought businesses and nonprofits together. We got near universal healthcare coverage. We were the first state in America to bring the environmental community and the oil and gas industry to address, aggressively address, methane emissions, and we were also the first place to expand reproductive rights on a scale basis and we reduced teen pregnancy by 54%. We\u2019ve done the big progressive things that people said couldn\u2019t be done.

What is your response to those who say nominating a socialist would re-elect Donald Trump?"}, {"speaker": "Bernie Sanders", "time": "06:30", "text": "Well, I think the responses at the polls, the last poll I saw has us 10 points ahead of Donald Trump because the American people understand that Trump is a phony, that Trump is a pathological liar and a racist, and that he lied to the American people during his campaign."}, {"speaker": "Bernie Sanders", "time": "06:53", "text": "He said he was going to stand up for working families, well President Trump, you\u2019re not standing up for working families when you try to throw 32 million people off their healthcare that they have, and that 83% of your tax benefits go to the top 1%. That\u2019s how we beat Trump.

You know, I have proposed getting to universal healthcare, which we need to do, it is a right. Healthcare is a right. We need to get to universal healthcare. I believe the way to do that is by finishing the work we started with Obamacare and creating a public option, that every family and every person in America can make a choice for their family about whether they want a public option, which for them would be like having Medicare for All, or whether they want to keep their private insurance."}, {"speaker": "Bennett", "time": "09:15", "text": "I believe we will get there much more quickly if we do that."}, {"speaker": "Bennett", "time": "09:19", "text": "[crosstalk 00:09:19]."}, {"speaker": "Bennett", "time": "09:20", "text": "Bernie \u2026 If I could just finish.

And just the value gains from having a stronger, healthier, mentally healthier population would increase GDP by $700 billion. This is the move that we have to make, particularly as technology is now automating away millions of American jobs. It\u2019s why Donald Trump is our President today, that we automated away four million manufacturing jobs in Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. And we\u2019re about to do the same thing to millions of retail jobs, call center jobs, fast food jobs, truck driving jobs, and on and on through the account."}, {"speaker": "Jose", "time": "13:01", "text": "So, if I get you \u2026 understand a little bit better. So you\u2019re saying $1,000 a month for everyone over 18, but a value added tax. So you can spend that $1,000 on value added tax?"}, {"speaker": "Andrew Yang", "time": "13:15", "text": "Well, the value added tax would end up \u2026 you\u2019d still be increasing the buying power of the bottom 94% of Americans. You have to spend a lot of money for a mild value add tax to eat up $12,000 a year per individual.

Congressman Swalwell, I want to talk a little bit about what Mr. Yang is talking about it, and you just actually mentioned.

That\u2019s why I think we should triple the amount of money we spend for Title 1 schools. That\u2019s why I think we should have universal pre-k. That\u2019s why I think every single person who graduates from high school, 65 out of a 100 now need something beyond high school, and we should provide for them to be able to get that education. That\u2019s why there should be free community college, cutting it in half the cost of college. That\u2019s why we should be in a position where we do not have anyone have to pay back a student debt when they get out if they are making less than $25,000 a year.
