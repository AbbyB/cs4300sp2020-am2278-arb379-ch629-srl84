They're always coming in from all over the place. This trend line is an average, a day-to-day average of all of those polls, put together. What you see here in this trend line is it's a very narrow range that Trump is operating in. What I mean by that is look at this. This is his high watermark, his peak, as President. His average approval rating at its best, 46%. When was this? Early February 2017. That was his honeymoon. He had just become President. That makes him different right there from every modern predecessor he has because all of them have gotten to 60, 65, 70%, at least for a short period. They all had honeymoons.

Trump's average support, at a low point, 36%. At a high point, about 43.5%.

And thirdly, I believe that you're not going to find anybody who has pulled together more of our alliances to deal with with what is the real stateless threat out there. We cannot go it alone in terms of dealing with terrorism.

I've experience with being in a marriage that exists by the grace of a single vote on the U.S. Supreme Court. I have the experience of guiding a community where the per capita income was below $20,000 when I took office into a brighter future. I'm running because the decisions we make in the next three or four years are going to decide how the next 30 or 40 go. When I get to the current age of the current president in the year 2055, I want to be able to look back on these years and say, “My generation delivered climate solutions, racial equality, and an end to endless war.” Help me deliver that new generation to Washington before it's too late.",

How come for the last 45 years wages have been stagnant for the middle class? How come we have the highest rate of childhood poverty? How come 45 million people still have student debt? How come three people own more wealth than the bottom half of America? And here is the answer. Nothing will change unless we have the guts to take on Wall Street, the insurance industry, the pharmaceutical industry, the military industrial complex, and the fossil fuel industry. If we don't have the guts to take them on, we'll continue to have plans, we'll continue to have talk, and the rich will get richer, and everybody else will be struggling.",
