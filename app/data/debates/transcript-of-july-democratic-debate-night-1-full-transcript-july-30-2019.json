Candidates, we’re about to begin opening statements, but first overview of the ground rules that your campaigns agreed to earlier this month to ensure a fair debate. As moderators, we will attempt to guide the discussion. You will each receive one minute to answer questions, 30 seconds for responses in rebuttals and 15 additional seconds if a moderator asks for a clarification. The timing lights will remind you of these limits. Please respect that and please refrain from interrupting your fellow candidates during their allotted time. A candidate infringing on another candidate’s time will have his or her time reduced. We also want to ask our audience inside the historic Fox theater to remain silent when the candidates are actively debating. The candidates need to be able to hear the questions and hear one another",

Yet watching that last debate, folks seem more concerned about scoring points or are doing each other with wishlist economics. Then making sure Americans know we hear their voices and it will help their lives. Look, I’m a pro choice, pro union, populist Democrat, that won three elections in a red state. Not by compromising our values, but by getting stuff done. That’s how we win back the places we lost. Showing up, listening, focusing on the challenges of every day Americans. That farmers are getting hit right now by Trump’s trade wars, that teacher work in a second job just to afford her insulin. They can’t wait for revolution. Their problems are on the here and now.

It was the idea that people, no matter who they were, would simply have the possibility of thriving. We have not ever totally actualized this ideal, but at the times when we have done best, we have tried. And when forces have opposed them, generations of Americans have risen up and pushed back against those forces. We did that with abolition and with women’s suffrage and with civil rights and now it is time, a generation of Americans to rise up again. For an amoral economic system has turned short term profits for huge multinational corporations into a false god and this new false god takes precedence over the safety and the health and the wellbeing of we, the American people and the people of the world and the planet on which we live. Conventional politics will not solve this problem because conventional politics is part of the problem. We, the American people must rise up and do what we do best and create a new possibility. Say no to what we don’t want and yes to what we know can be true. I’m Marianne Williamson and that’s why I’m running for president.",

The biggest problem right now that we have with immigration is Donald Trump. He’s using immigration to not only rip apart families, but rip apart this country. We can actually get to the point where we have both safe borders, where we have a path to citizenship, where we have opportunities for dreamers. And you don’t have to decriminalize everything. What you have to do is have a president in there with the judgment and the decency to treat someone that comes to the border like one of our own.",

But for politicians, including my fellow candidates, who themselves have taken tens of thousands, in some cases hundreds of thousands of dollars from these same corporate donors, to think that they now have the moral authority to say we’re going to take them on, I don’t think the Democratic Party should be surprised that so many Americans believe yada, yada, yada. It is time for us to start over with people who have not taken donations from any of these corporations and can say with real moral authority, “That is over.

What happened in Flint would not have happened in Grosse Pointe. This is part of the dark underbelly of American society. The racism, the bigotry, and the entire conversation that we’re having here tonight. If you think any of this wonkiness is is going to deal with this dark psychic force of the collectivized hatred that this president is bringing up in this country, then I’m afraid that the Democrats are going to see some very dark days. We need to say it like it is. It’s bigger than Flint. It’s all over this country. It’s particularly people of color. It’s particularly people who do not have the money to fight back. And if the Democrats don’t start saying it then why would those people feel that they’re there for us? And if those people don’t feel it they won’t vote for us and Donald Trump will win. Thank you.",

Right now, in the wake of a police-involved shooting, our community is moving from hurting to healing by making sure that the community can participate in things like revising the use-of-force policy and making sure there are community voices on the board of safety that handles police matters. I proposed a Douglass plan to tackle this issue nationally, because mayors have hit the limits of what you can do unless there is national action. Systemic racism has touched every part of American life, from housing to health to home ownership. If you walk into an emergency room and you are black, your reports of pain will be taken less seriously.

It is time for us to simply realize that this country will not heal. All that a country is as a collection of people. People heal when there is some deep truth-telling. We need to recognize that, when it comes to the economic gap between blacks and whites in America, it does come from a great injustice that has never been dealt with. That great injustice has had to do with the fact that there was 250 years of slavery followed by another 100 years of domestic terrorism. What makes me qualified to say 200 to 500 billion dollars? I’ll tell you what makes me qualified. If you did the math of the 40 acres and a mule, given that there was four to five million slaves at the end of the civil war, four to five, and they were all promised 40 acres and a mule for every family of four. If you did the math today, it would be trillions of dollars. And I believe that anything less than a hundred billion dollars is an insult.

She got sick, went to the emergency room and got hooked on opioids. The last thing that she said to her mom was, “Momma, it’s not my fault,” and she died. A lot of Americans say the same thing every day, and that is what I will stand up for. What I will stand up against are companies like those pharma companies that got her hooked on those opioids and didn’t tell the doctors or the patients what was going to happen. We need someone that has people’s back. We also need someone that can win, and I have won in these red districts. I win in the Midwest. I can win in states like Wisconsin, and Michigan and Iowa. I also will do my job without fear or favor just like I did as a prosecutor and get through the gridlock like I’ve done as a senator where I’ve passed over a hundred bills where I’ve been the lead Democrat. Last, yes, I will govern with integrity. We have the President where people turn off their TV when they see him. Not me. I will make you proud as your president.",

To meet this challenge, we have to have hope in one another and a faith in a future of this country that includes everyone. My whole life I’ve been including people in the success of this country. Starting a business with high value, high wage, high skilled jobs in the third poorest urban county in America. Serving on the city council and holding town hall meetings every single week to remind myself who it is that I serve at the end of the day. In Congress, being in the minority but working with Democrats and Republicans alike to deliver for my constituents and this country. Then in Texas this last year, traveling to every county not writing anybody off, not taking anyone for granted. At the end of the day, winning more votes than any Democrat had in the history of the state. Winning independence for the first time in decades, and winning nearly half a million Republicans and those 38 Electoral College votes in Texas are now in play. I can win them. That is how we defeat Donald Trump in November of 2020 and how we bring this divided country together again in January of 2021. Thank you.",

It’s only getting tougher. By 2030, we will have passed the point of no return on climate. There could be 130 million more guns on our streets. I’ll be in my 40s then. If you have kids, think about how old they will be then. Here’s the good news. It’s not too late. We can tell our kids that before we ran out of time, just before we ran out of time in 2020, we did what it took to deliver a climate that we didn’t have to wonder if it could support us, to deliver a society where race has no bearing on your health or your wealth or your relationship with law enforcement, that we did what it took to deliver an economy where a rising tide actually does lift all boats. We can do this if and only if we are ready to walk away from what hasn’t worked with bold action and win, not only defeat this President but defeat his congressional allies with a defeat so big that it reunites the Republican Party with its conscience as well as bringing Democrats to office.

For me, what this election is all about is opportunity. Every budget, every policy that we talk about is about who’s going to get opportunity. Is it going to go to the billionaires, or is it going to go to our kids? Right now for decades, we have had a government that has been on the side of the rich and the powerful. It has been on the side of the wealthy. That means it has not been on the side of everyone else. Not on the side of people living on our Native American reservations, people living in inner cities, people living on small farms and small communities across this country. How do we beat it? We beat it by being the party of big structural change. Give people a reason to show up and vote. We beat it by building a grassroots movement across this country, not showing up behind closed doors with millionaires but actually building it person-by-person across this country with small dollar donations, with volunteers, with people who show up and say, “I have a stake in this democracy.” I will not only beat Donald Trump in 2020, I’ll start to make real change come 2021.",

I’m running to transform this country and to stand with the working class of America, which for the last 45 years has been decimated. Two days ago, I had a remarkable experience, which should tell you everything you need to know about what’s going on in America. I took 15 people with diabetes from Detroit a few miles into Canada, and we bought insulin for one-tenth the price being charged by the crooks who run the pharmaceutical industry in America today. It’s not just the price fixing and the corruption and the greed of the pharmaceutical industry, it’s what’s going on in the fossil fuel industry. It’s what’s going on in Wall Street. It’s what’s going on with the prison industrial complex. We need a mass political movement. Please go to BernieSanders.com. Become one of our million volunteers.

We saw candidates clashing onstage, sometimes sharply, on policy without resorting to name calling at all. We saw Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren answer tough questions from their opponents and the panel on healthcare and how to pay for it. There is certainly a clear divide in the Democratic Party right now across a wide range of issues, and that too played out onstage. Now, whether or not, as Senator Warren said a moment ago, Democrats want to be the party of big structural change, it was a serious clash of ideas certainly, and philosophies, and yes, personalities as well. If you came into this looking to learn what exactly Democrats believed what they think is good for the country and what they think is the best way to beat Donald Trump, well, it was all there tonight on that stage. We’re going to focus on all of it in the hours ahead. My colleague, Chris Cuomo, and I will be talking to some of the candidates who you saw tonight. We’ll of course be joined by some of the best political and journalistic voices around as well. CNN Chief National Correspondent, John King, is with us. Host of CNN’s Inside Politics, CNN’s Senior Political Reporter, Nia-Malika Henderson, is with us as well. CNN’s Senior Political Commentator, Axe Files Host, and former Senior Obama Advisor, David Axelrod joins us here. CNN’s Chief Political Analyst, Gloria Borger is with us as well.

The big challenge tonight is the great question after tonight and tomorrow night, who gets to continue the fight? So, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders stood their ground tonight. They were in the middle of the stage. They were challenged repeatedly. Can you sell these big ideas? Is the country ready for this? Can the country afford this? Will you hand Donald Trump reelection? I think they both stood feistily and fought back. Elizabeth Warren from the very beginning saying, “Don’t have small ideas, and don’t be spineless,” a direct challenge to those who were challenging her and Senator Sanders. They did not go at each other. They will have to some day. They hold too much space in this primary to not have a fight at some point, but that was delayed as they held their ground against the moderates. I think the big question is, which of the moderates survive? That’s not up to us. That’s up to Democratic donors and Democratic voters who have to either send them money or raise them in the polls, because this in some ways, I don’t want to make it reality TV, is about survival. To make the next round of debates, several of those moderates right now don’t meet the test. So, Governor Bullock, pretty decent night. Do voters believe that? Does he rise up in the polls? Does he get some money?",
