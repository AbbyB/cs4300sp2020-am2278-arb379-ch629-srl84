It's really a town hall organized by LULAC co-produced by [foreign language 00:00:57]. Before we get started, a big thank you to essential workers, our healthcare workers, the people on the front line, the people who are making sure that the country keeps some sort of social order in this unprecedented crisis. They are risking their lives to protect ours and this country and all of us. All of them, the financial stability for them, for their families, and of course the access to healthcare, and to protect their health while they're doing this important work for everyone.

For allowing Univision [foreign language 00:01:46] to be part of this conversation. We have a special message from presidential candidate Joe Biden. We'll introduce him in a little bit. But we'll also be hearing from the family members of workers on the front lines. I do want to ask you to pay close attention to what they have to say. We've heard from workers in the past, we've heard from workers during this emergency, but it's probably the first time that we're hearing from their families. This is again, incredibly important. It's happening because some of these workers are afraid to share their experiences. And their family members are speaking on their behalf.",

I'll let Domingo Garcia, the LULAC National President introduce the rest of the panel. And of course the special message by presidential candidate Joe Biden.

We need to make sure that we take care of them. Like we do take care of those first responders in our hospitals. That means we've got to provide them safe working conditions.

Meatpacking has always been a hard work and it takes incredible physical toll on labor, on the best of conditions. It's always been dangerous. It's always been underpaid.

Nursing homes and meat packing plants, are the most dangerous places there are right now. That's not up for debate. Thousands of infections have been traced back to meat packing plants and at least 30 workers have died from it. They designate them as essential workers, then treat them as disposable.

First, that if you're going to use the Defense Production Act, it ought to be done to create testing in this country so that everybody can get tested. Two, the issue of immigration status really doesn't just go to the point of meatpacking workers, but for all essential workers, whether it be in healthcare, groceries, utilities, farm working, you name it. Given the crisis we're in, it is my view that every single one of those people that are doing essential work in this time of crisis deserve a green card. At the very least, like I said earlier, the hypocrisy of the Defense Production Act order putting meat plant workers in a situation like Trump would do it, at the very least, he needs to go back and amend and exempt those very workers from his deportation order of 2017.",
