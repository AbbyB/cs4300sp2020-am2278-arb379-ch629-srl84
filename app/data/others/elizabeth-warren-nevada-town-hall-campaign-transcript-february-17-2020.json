And also just a big shout out to the moms who demand action who have changed Nevada, stand up, and are going to change America. I also want to say a very special thank you to Lisa who started us on welcoming everyone. It is our one year anniversary. Where are you, Lisa? There she is. Lisa and I were first together here in Nevada when I came here exactly a year ago today to start this fight in Nevada. I want to thank you all for being here today. You can tell I'm a little husky. I'm shaking off a cold and I'm going to try to do my best to save my voice. So if it's okay with everybody, I thought what I'd do is I'm just going to tell you a story that I haven't told for a long time now. I've told it a while back, but haven't told it for awhile. About why I'm in this fight. So you know a little bit about my heart and you know a little bit about my commitment. And then we'll take some questions and then when we get to the most important part and that is the selfies. I'll stay for them, anybody that wants to take selfies.",

My mother always just called me the surprise. My three older brothers are all retired now. They're back in Oklahoma. My three older brothers went off and joined the military. When we were growing up, our daddy had a lot of different jobs. He sold paint, he sold fencing, he sold carpet, he sold housewares. And when I was in middle school, my three brothers were gone by then. Everybody had headed out then. And it was just my mom and my dad and me. And my daddy had a heart attack and for awhile we thought we were going to lose him. Some of you know what that's like as a kid, it's really scary. Folks from church brought covered dishes. Everybody spoke in hushed tones. But daddy made it through and came home but he couldn't go back to work.",

She had her slip on and her stockings and she was pacing and had her head down and she kept saying over and over, “We will not lose this house. We will not lose this house. We will not lose this house.” She was 50 years old, she had never worked outside the home, and she was terrified. And finally, she looked up and she saw me standing on the doorway. I'm just a kid. And she didn't say anything. She looked at me and she looked at that dress and she looked back at me and she walked over, picked it up, wrestled it on, put on her high heels, and walked to the Sears Roebuck where she got a minimum wage job answering phones, a minimum wage job that saved our house and it saved our family.",

It would pay the mortgage, it would cover the utilities, and it would put groceries on the table.

What does it take a family of three to get a foothold in America's middle class? What does it take a family of three to have something solid that they can build on? Today, the question asked in our government in Washington is where do we set the minimum wage to maximize the profits of giant multinational corporations? Well, I don't want a government that works for giant multinational corporations. I want one that works for our families. And there it is, the whole story of why I am in this fight.",

Now, let me just explain it to anybody who hasn't already heard about it. The basic idea is a two cent tax on the great fortunes in this country. So your first 50 million is free and clear. I see, yeah, exactly, going … This woman is not unreasonable. But on your 50 millionth and first dollar, you've got to pitch in 2 cents. And 2 cents on every dollar after that. You hit a billion, you got to pitch in a couple of pennies more. That's the basic idea. Anybody in here own a home or grow up in a family that owned a home? Yeah, you all paid wealth tax. You still are. It's just called a property tax. And the only difference here is I'm saying that for the billionaires and the millionaires, the property tax shouldn't just include the real estate. It should also include the stock portfolio, the diamonds, the Rembrandt, and the yacht. They can afford it.",

But their basic argument is, “Look, I had a great idea, I followed it through, I worked hard.” And I say, “Good for you. You did and that's great. Good for you. You're a success, that's great. But understand this. You built a great fortune here in America. You built it, at least in part, using workers all of us help pay to educate. You built it, at least in part, getting your goods to market on roads and bridges all of us helped pay to build.

It's enough to help us restructure this economy. Two cents, two cents from the top folks. Let me just tell you quick what we can do. We can do, oh and I see one, universal child care for every baby in this country age zero to five. Universal pre-k for every three year old and four year old in America. And we can stop exploiting the people, largely black and brown women who do this work. We can raise the wages of every childcare worker and preschool teacher in America.

We can help level the playing field and put $50 billion of new money into our historically black colleges and universities. And I'm not through yet.

Because that kind of looks like you might be able to manage the student loan payments. But also opening up other avenues for people who truly are drowning in student loan debt. For example, changing the bankruptcy laws are important. So I want to make, though, a quick pitch off your question because I think this is important. About let me just pick childcare. We have a problem in America. We got a lot of problems, but I want to focus on one and that is trickle down economics has been a complete disaster for this country.",

A two cent tax on the great fortunes, think about the great fortunes. They already have their own money managers, their own PR firms, their own everything, right? Accountants, everything.

Paid family leave and it's both for taking care of babies and kids, it's also for when you get sick, and it's also for taking care of elderly family members when they need help. So all the way. If I can, though, I want to say a quick question about the plan. It's a great plan. And I can say that because the origin of the plan is not mine. It's Kirsten Gillibrand's. And it's a part of what I have tried to do in my campaign from the beginning is to say this is not a competition in the sense of my plans are good and everybody else's plans are bad. It's to say, “Listen, let's take good plans wherever they come from.” And when Kirsten left the race, I called her the next day and said first that I was sorry and second, how would she feel if I brought her paid family leave plan, which is a really good plan, in with my plans and give her full credit for it and lift it up? And she said, “Let's do it.” Kamala Harris said the same thing on a terrific plan on protecting women's reproductive freedom. Same thing with Jay Inslee on climate plans that I've brought in. And my good friend Julian Castro both on immigration and on pre-K.",

They're afraid for children in lock downs in our public schools. They're afraid for women. They're afraid for people of color. They're afraid for LGBTQ people, for trans people, all of whose rights are up for grabs in this Supreme Court. They are afraid for our nation and they are afraid for our planet.

Me, I'm fighting back. I'm in this race to fight back. You bet. Yes. Fighting back is an act of patriotism. We fought back against a king to build this country. We fought back against the scourge of slavery to save this union. We fought back against a great depression to rebuild this economy. We fought back against the spread of fascism to protect our democracy. America is at it's best when it sees a big problem and we fight back. This is no time for small ideas. This is no time to nibble around the edges of big problems. This is the time to see these problems and to provide the big structural change we need to build a better America.",

I am not running a campaign with proposals that are carefully designed not to offend big donors. I passed that stop sign a long time ago. I am running a campaign based on a lifetime of fighting for working families. I am running a campaign from the heart because I believe in you. And like Brandon said, I believe in the America we can build together, an America where every person has value, an America where every child is worth investing in, an America where in our democracy, people, not money, is the most important part.
