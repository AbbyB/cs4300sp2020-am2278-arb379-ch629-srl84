And I talk to him every day with other healthcare providers and experts. And he was telling me about a friend of his up in New York who is said he just had two young men die on his table. One was I think 26 years old. And I think a marathoner, don\u2019t hold me to that, in great shape and another was 28 years old. This was only going to get worse. It\u2019s not going to get better. And there\u2019s a real sense of panic that\u2019s occurring around the country and among some, I won\u2019t say panic, but great concern among healthcare providers and first responders."

And so I said, \u201cGreat.\u201d And I stayed a second, that\u2019s why I was a few minutes late. I said, \u201cWhat did he say?\u201d And I read the statement. It\u2019s all about ventilators, which is really important. It should have been done four weeks ago, but he should employ that Defense Production Act for all the things needed, gloves, masks, face shields, gowns, et cetera. That should be done yesterday, last week, a month ago, get it done now. And for example, tests, we\u2019re in a situation where we have tests that are not being distributed, number one, because there\u2019s no one person, no commander in the White House or the administration like a military commander determining distribution of what is available. And we have to be using the Defense Production Act to get companies who have the capacity to gather all the materials needed for the test, assemble them and move now."

And the healthcare workers and I watch your interviews and everyone else\u2019s interviews on TV. And there\u2019s so many examples of these. I\u2019ve watched last night, a young doctor saying how frightened he was to go into the room, but he said he thought about how soldiers go in and so he why didn\u2019t he have more courage? He\u2019s going to do it, but it\u2019s frightening to go in and\u2026 People are really worried. Let\u2019s get on the job providing what is needed. You asked the third part of your question related to whether or not, well, what was the third part of your question, actually? You asked three pieces. Yep."

We need to do more, which I\u2019ll be speaking to and that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to talk to the president about if he takes my call, if that gets set up. We need another package.

Senator Sanders is kind of making a new push regardless of the gap between you two and delegates to try to bring the conversation back to Medicare for All saying that this scenario proves the private sector can\u2019t meet this kind of demand. Can you restate why is it that you are still coming at this and it\u2019s a public option is the better model to get more people covered and more people care?"

The idea that this would have stopped the virus from occurring, the idea it would have been able to be implemented earlier, the idea it would have fundamentally changed anything, it\u2019s just not accurate. And besides, you got to pass what is a $35 trillion bill over the next 10 years. Mildly complicated at the same time here. And so what we should be doing is having the Affordable Care Act, add the public option for those who want it, meaning Medicare, if that\u2019s what they want, rather than keep their own health insurance policies. If you notice, it\u2019s not about whether or not the health insurance is available to people that have private insurance. It\u2019s not about that now. It\u2019s about whether or not the government is going to be able to implement all the things that they\u2019re supposed to be doing. And so I don\u2019t see where Medicare for All would make any difference in terms of the speed with which and the recovery rate, which would occur if in fact it existed."

All I know is that in the conversations in the past, have been a long time I\u2019ve had with him. They\u2019ve been respectful, they\u2019ve been straightforward.

Just like what happens in a war time. And we\u2019ve talked to the president, he says he\u2019s more a wartime president. This is a war against this virus. There\u2019s a number of specific suggestions that I know from in the past worked and some I think would work. And I\u2019m prepared to offer them to the president. I understand if he doesn\u2019t want to take my advice but it won\u2019t be, \u201cI told you so, Mr. President.\u201d It won\u2019t be if he decided to do what I suggested, I go back and say, \u201cWell, I told the president to do that.\u201d"

A convention having tens of thousands of people in one arena is very different than having people walk into a polling booth with accurate spacing to six to 10 feet apart, one at a time going in and having machines scrubbed down, but I do think you\u2019re going to be a lot more, I think you could hold the election as well dealing with mail-in ballots and same day registration. I mean, there\u2019s a lot of things that can be done. That\u2019s for Wisconsin courts and folks to decide. But I think it\u2019s possible to do both, to have both more mail-in ballots, people and today\u2019s the last day it gets until 5:00 to ask for one. There\u2019s an hour time difference from where I am in Wisconsin. And I think it could be done based on what I\u2019m being hearing from the news and what I understand the governor and others are saying, but that\u2019s for them to decide."
