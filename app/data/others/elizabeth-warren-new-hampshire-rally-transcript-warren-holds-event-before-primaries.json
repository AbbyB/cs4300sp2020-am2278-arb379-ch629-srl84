After this impeachment effort his favorables are up, he\u2019s polling better than ever.\u201d I thought, \u201cWell, that has a way of focusing your mind.\u201d We have one job come November and that is beat Donald Trump. But we also have a second job and that is take back the Senate and put Mitch McConnell out of a job. We got to do this."

He had a 60% approval rating, he had $10 million in the bank, had a great story, he was very telegenic and he had just beaten a very competent woman, very strong smart woman, in a Senate race couple of years earlier. He was coming up for re-election and there are a lot of good, strong Democrats in Massachusetts who had a lot of electoral experience, who looked at that and said, \u201cYou could walk into a buzzsaw running against that guy,\u201d and so didn\u2019t get into the race, didn\u2019t get into the race, didn\u2019t get into the race."

I started out 19 points down, and I got to tell you, my first campaign, never done it before, I got knocked on my fanny multiple times during that campaign. But you know what I did? Every single time I got back up. On election day, a bunch of folks were saying, \u201cNot sure which way this is going to go. Could go this way, could go that way.\u201d I beat him by seven and a half points. It\u2019s about getting in the fight."

When I was a girl, and my family didn\u2019t have much, my daddy ended up as a janitor, when he had a heart attack it turned our family upside down financially. The long, long weeks that he was out of work, no money coming in, we were on the edge of losing it at all. My mother got a minimum wage job at the Sears and that minimum wage job saved our family. The way it saved our family is it was a minimum wage job at a time in America when a minimum wage job would cover a mortgage, the utilities and put groceries on the table. Today, a minimum wage job in America will not keep a mama and a baby out of poverty. That is wrong and that is why I am in this fight."

When I was a girl, the question asked in Washington about the minimum wage was what does it take a family of three to survive? What does it take a family of three to get a toehold in America\u2019s middle-class? What does it take a family of three to build something solid that they can then build a future for themselves and their children on? Today, the question asked in Washington about the minimum wage is where do we set the minimum wage to maximize the profits of giant multinational corporations? Well, I don\u2019t want a government that works for giant multinational corporations. I want one that works for our families."

Corruption. Corruption. It\u2019s about the influence of money everywhere in Washington.

We can\u2019t just look the other way and say, \u201cOh, that\u2019s just kind of the reality.\u201d No. If we\u2019re going to fix it, we got to have some big structural change.

But it\u2019s not just at the federal level. Think about how gerrymandering undercuts everything, how the electoral college, because it means some votes are worth a whole lot more than others.

Basic idea says your accumulated wealth, how much you own, if your first 50 million is free and clear, guy in the back says, but your 50 millionth and first dollar you got to pitch in two cents and two cents on every dollar after that. You get to be a billion dollars, you\u2019ve got to pitch in a couple of pennies more. And the idea behind it, anybody in here own a home or grew up in a family that owned a home? You pay a wealth tax. It\u2019s just called a property tax."

So with no thought, with no time for planning, she wrapped her baby up and ran for the border and made her way, a dangerous journey, made her way to our border where she had been put in a cage. A great nation teaches, treats every human being with dignity. What\u2019s happening at our borders must stop. Must stop. So how do we do that? Think about the origin of the problem. This problem is in no small part made by Donald Trump. It\u2019s a problem that starts down in Central America. Taking away aid from Central America, destabilized the governments that had only a tenuous hold anyway. I will restore aid to Central America. I\u2019ll work on economic development, get our allies to work on it so that people are not forced to flee because they are afraid of the gangs because they see no future for themselves and their children."

It\u2019s a problem in our democracy. If you have to be a billionaire, or suck up to billionaires, to get the nomination to run for President as a Democrat? Then buckle up, because we\u2019re going to have an America that just works better for billionaires, and worse and worse for everyone else. I\u2019m in this fight to recover our democracy, to build a democracy that works from the grass roots, up. I\u2019m in it all the way, on this one. Thank you."

And here\u2019s how it goes. When I was a young mom, toasters could burn down houses. And the way that worked is, you know those little toaster ovens? They didn\u2019t have automatic shut off switches. So you could put four slices of bread in one of those toaster ovens, flick the thing on. Hear the baby cry, run down to the other end of the house. Stay down there longer than you had thought you had, and when you come back, the flames are leaping off the toast about six to eight inches. Catches the kitchen curtains on fire, and then the kitchen cabinets."

So deep in the pocket of the banks, it said, \u201cKeep on selling those things, because that\u2019s how you make big profits.\u201d And that\u2019s what crashed our economy in 2008."

You could make a real difference. Structural change.\u201d The second was, \u201cDon\u2019t even try. Don\u2019t try, because you\u2019ll be up against big money. You\u2019ll be up against Wall Street, you\u2019ll be up against all the Republicans. And shoot, you\u2019ll be up against half the Democrats. You\u2019ll never get it done.\u201d I get it. Big structural change is hard. But it was the right thing to do. So we got in the fight. We took on big money. We got people engaged. And in 2010, President Obama signed that agency into law. We won. We can win these fights. And that little agency, that little agency, has already forced the banks to return more than $12 billion directly to people they cheated. We can make government work for the people. We can do this."
