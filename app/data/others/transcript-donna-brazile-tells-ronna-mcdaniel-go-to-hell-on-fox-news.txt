First of all, stay the hell out of our race. Stay the hell out of our race. I get sick and tired, Ed and Sandra, of listening to Republicans tell me and the Democrats about our process. First of all, they don\u2019t have a process. They\u2019re canceling primaries. They have winner take all. They don\u2019t have the kind of democracy that we see on the Democratic side.

I\u2019m tired of it, Ed. We\u2019re not trying to prevent anyone from becoming the nominee. If you have the delegates and win, you will win. This notion that somehow or another, Democrats are out there trying to put hurdles or roadblocks before one candidate, that\u2019s stupid. I know what\u2019s going on. They are scared of Democrats coming together to defeat Donald Trump. They need to be focusing on what we\u2019re focusing on in the Democratic Party and that is preventing foreign interference in our election.

Stop using it."}, {"speaker": "Sandra Smith", "time": "01:48", "text": "Donna, with all due respect [crosstalk 00:01:50] We had her on to talk about what she sees happening here in the same way that we ask you."}, {"speaker": "Donna Brazile", "time": "01:55", "text": "Put me on with her. No, but Sandra, she\u2019s not a Democrat.

We know that taking an incumbent president out of the Oval Office is going to be tough, that\u2019s tough. But Donald Trump needs to understand that the Democratic Party is a party composed of Americans, regardless of your political beliefs. Some people are leftists, some people are moderates but we\u2019re all American voters.
