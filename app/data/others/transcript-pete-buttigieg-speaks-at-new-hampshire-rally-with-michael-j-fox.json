I was watching the debate last night and it occurred to me I love all the Democratic nominees and I think they're all terrific and I have respect for all of them, but they're all yelling at me. I was sitting there and I said, “Why are you yelling at me, Bernie? What did I do to you?” I said, “They're all screaming.” But Pete isn't screaming. He's just talking to me. He's the one guy who's just quiet and just making his point and it's a point I agree with on almost all the issues. All issues. I can't tell you one I don't. I'll just allow for the possibility that he might be, “You have to wear purple on Fridays,” or something. But I want to tell a story about the first time I saw… Well, the temperament and that idea that he can talk to you and not yell at you [inaudible 00:01:35].",

I could tell they thought, who is this guy? And trying to answer this and then he would answer that and then they'd say, well how about this? And he would answer that. He'd do it very quickly.

You are lucky to have somebody representing you in New Hampshire, in Washington DC, a place where I know there's so much frustration and exhaustion and even a sense of darkness sometimes when we turn on the news. But if you look at what Congresswoman Kuster and her colleagues are doing in the House to try to make sure that prescription drugs are affordable, to try to raise wages, to try to protect Americans from gun violence on issue after issue, they are there. Let us send them a president who will make sure that their work gets completed. One of our best conversations was about, not policy alone, but the qualities and the values that we cared about. She shared qualities and values that she had learned from her upbringing and talked a lot about courage and grace and how those two values mean so much as we're trying to get things done together.

But it is also a time for those of us who have not had the lived experience of systemic racism and discrimination in the way that you do when you are African American in this country to ask of ourselves how we are making ourselves useful as allies. We can always do a better job listening. We can always show up.

They can agree that part of how we honor our troops in uniform and in danger is to put an end to endless war and ensure they're never asked to go, unless there is no alternative. And thanks to everybody here who served. Who can agree that we support our next generation by supporting our teachers and we ought to back them up with a Secretary of Education who believes in public education? On issue after issue, I'm seeing the majority come together that will not only make it possible to win the next election, but make it possible to govern on the road ahead, make it possible for us to actually deliver the changes that this country knows that we need, and that even though they command a majority among the American people, up until now can't seem to get a majority in the American Senate.

Knowing that the course of my own life was changed by the orders that sent me to a foreign war, issued by a decision made in the White House. Knowing that my marriage, most important thing in my life, this ring on my finger, exists by the grace of a single vote on the United States Supreme Court. That's what this election means to all of us, to each of us, in a different way. And it's not even just about voters. Because so many of the most powerful voices I have encountered in this campaign are people not even yet old enough to vote. An 11-year-old who sticks up his hand at an event and asks me what we're going to do so that he'll be able to afford insulin in the future. He's worried about this at the age of 11. And the only responsible answer is that we, anybody old enough to vote, is supposed to sort this out and take care of it and worry about it so you don't have to. A 14-year-old who lets me know she's written a will because she's that afraid of what'll happen to her at school. Shame on us if we don't take care of that by the time she is old enough to vote.",

That is who we are seeking to defend, to support, and to do right by.

First of all, the word “entitlement.” We hear that a lot to describe Social Security and Medicare. Well, as a voter put it recently, I don't know if this term will catch on, but I like it. He stood up and said, “I don't think of it as an entitlement. I think of it as a paid-into-ment because I've been paying for it my whole working life.”",

And that is why we have to make sure that it's on good solid ground. Now there are some folks who say, “Well, we're not going to be able to keep Social Security solvent unless we cut benefits.” But it isn't true. It's only true if we refuse to look at revenue. All we've got to do is raise the cap on income over $250,000 and allow that to pay into Social Security. We take that one step, that one step alone, and the Social Security trust fund will be in good shape, at least into the 2050s when I expect to be collecting. So I've got a bit of a personal stake in this. And we'll be in a position to increase the generosity of the program too in certain important ways. I'll give you one that I think is particularly important, caregiving for loved ones. Family caregiving is not considered work. Well, at least it's not compensated as work. But it's work, especially when it takes you out of the workforce in order to do it. And so even though you don't get a W-2 for taking care of a loved one, I believe for the purposes of Social Security, a year spent as a family caregiver should count as a year in the working world.",

I can have a conversation with somebody from maybe a different branch in a different generation and served in different places, but we have that thing in common. When I was deployed, there were people I was deployed with who were radically different from me. I mean regionally, racially, politically. Definitely politically very different.
