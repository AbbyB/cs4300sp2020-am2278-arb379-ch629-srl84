You\u2019ve got workers who are worried that they can\u2019t afford to send their kids to college. You\u2019ve got a half of the older workers in America, people put 55 or older. Do you know how much they have in the bank, saved for retirement? Nothing! Now, think about it. You\u2019re a 60 year old worker in the St. Louis or Kansas City. You work your whole life, you\u2019re worried about retirement. You got nothing in the bank. Maybe you\u2019ll have $15,000 a year social security, if they don\u2019t cut it. You\u2019re a working mommy in st Louis. Maybe you\u2019re a single mom. You\u2019re going to work today\u2026 And God bless the single moms in this country and how they survive. Don\u2019t know how they do it, but that mom, think of the mom, you\u2019re making 15 bucks an hour. Where are you going to find quality, affordable childcare for your kid? Virtually impossible. You\u2019re a young person coming from a working class family. You want to go to college, you want to go to a trade school, but you can\u2019t afford it. Your dreams being destroyed. Maybe you made it through college and you leave school 50, 80,000 bucks in debt. You went to graduate school, maybe you\u2019re a couple of hundred thousand dollars in debt. That is the reality. I grew up in a family, didn\u2019t have any money, lived paycheck to paycheck. I know a little bit about that and half of the American people in this richest country in the history of the world, half of our people today are living paycheck to paycheck.

Wealthiest country on earth, why do we have more people in jail, disproportionally African American, Latino, and Native American, than any other country on earth including China, a communist, authoritarian nation, four times our size. We have more people in jail today than China does. How does it happen? Let\u2019s think about it. How does it happen again? We don\u2019t talk about these issues. Today as we speak there are 400,000 people in jail who have not been convicted of anything. Anyone know why that\u2019s so? How do you get end up in jail if you\u2019re not convicted?"

Maybe you\u2019re innocent, but you can\u2019t get out of jail. You don\u2019t have a decent lawyer because you can\u2019t afford a decent lawyer and the legal system is not providing you with a decent lawyer. 400,000 people in jail today not having been convicted of anything. Then you have a situation in America today where people are making money, locking up fellow Americans."

My point here is to ask you to think that in a general election, which candidate can generate the enthusiasm and the excitement and the voter turnout we need? If you want to defeat Trump, which all Democrats do, a majority of Independents and some Republicans do, we are that campaign. But second of all, what we also understand is that while it is absolutely imperative that we beat Trump, we\u2019ve got to do more than that. You\u2019ve got to transform this country so that we have an economy that works for you and you and you, not just wealthy campaign contributors.
