You know, no matter what our political views may be, the people of America understand we cannot continue to have a President who is a pathological liar, who is corrupt, who does not understand our constitution, and is trying to divide our people up based on the color of their skin, based on their religion, their sexual orientation or where they were born. And all of that hatred, all of that divisiveness, is going to end when together we are in the white house."}, {"speaker": "Bernie Sanders", "time": "02:54", "text": "We are going to win this election because the people of the United States are sick and tired of a massive level of income and wealth inequality. They don\u2019t want tax breaks for billionaires and cuts to Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.

And that is why together we will make public colleges and universities tuition free, and why we will cancel all student debt in America.

They understand that the time is now for us to take on the fossil fuel industry, to transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energies. And as President of the United States, because this is a global issue, not just an American issue, we are going to speak to the people in China and Russia and countries all over this world and say, maybe just maybe instead of spending 1.8 trillion dollars a year on weapons of destruction designed to kill each other, maybe we should pool our resources and fight our common enemy, which is climate change."}, {"speaker": "Bernie Sanders", "time": "06:33", "text": "And the people of America know the time is long overdue for major reforms to a broken and racist criminal justice system.

Trump grew up in New York City in a 23 room, nine bathroom mansion. I grew up out in Oklahoma in a two bedroom house with one bathroom and a converted garage where my three brothers slept. By the time he was three, Donald Trump was getting a $200,000 allowance every year from his dad\u2019s real estate empire. In total, he got nearly half a billion dollars from his dad. Me, I took on small jobs to make money babysitting, waitressing, sewing dresses for my aunts. Donald Trump claimed bone spurs to avoid the draft. All three of my older brothers signed up for military service and the oldest spent five and a half years off and on in combat in Vietnam."}, {"speaker": "Elizabeth Warren", "time": "02:22", "text": "Before he became a reality TV host, Donald Trump spent most of his career running one company after another into bankruptcy.

Before I was even elected to office, I built an entire federal agency to stop big banks and financial institutions from cheating people.

He believes that government is just one more thing to exploit, a tool to enrich himself and his corrupt buddies at everyone else\u2019s expense. I believe government should work for everyone. We don\u2019t know all the results tonight, but tonight has already showed that Americans have a deep hunger for big structural change to make our economy and our democracy work for everyone. Tonight showed that our path to victory is to fight hard for the changes Americans are demanding, changes that Democrats, Independents, and Republicans are demanding. Tonight showed that our agenda isn\u2019t just a progressive agenda. It isn\u2019t just a democratic agenda. It\u2019s an American agenda."}, {"speaker": "Elizabeth Warren", "time": "04:29", "text": "Throughout our history, when moments of prices have called on us to meet big challenges, Americans have answered the call.

In the 19 \u2026 In the 1700s, when people said we can never overthrow a King and form a new Republic, farmers and merchants came together and fought side by side until we won our independence. In the 1800s, people said that slavery would endure forever and African Americans would never see liberation. But abolitionists, enslaved and formerly enslaved people formed an underground railroad and more than 2 million people waged a war to defeat the tyranny of slavery."}, {"speaker": "Elizabeth Warren", "time": "05:32", "text": "And in the 1900s, people said we could never rescue our economy from the depths of the Great Depression or defeat fascism, but we forged a new deal.

And here in Iowa, that\u2019s what happened. You came together, you organized, you showed that we are united in our conviction, that hope defeats fear, that courage overcomes cynicism. That we will always be a stronger party and a stronger nation. When we unite around our shared values to advance justice and expand opportunity to everyone.
