You deserve a government, a government that\u2019s working hard for you and you are as hard as you are working for us. The government that not only sets, but enforces worker safety standards, a government that ensures everyone has the option of paid sick leave. A government that provides universal access to affordable high-quality healthcare, which this guy\u2019s not doing it all."

First, I think it\u2019s immoral.

I know unions and worker advocates aren\u2019t happy with how vague the OSHA standard is. We had trouble getting it even done and until this week there wasn\u2019t even enforcing these guidelines.

It\u2019s all within their capacity to do it. So that is the first most important thing we should be doing, because you should not have to go into work tomorrow or whenever you go back, and have to worry whether or not you\u2019re standing too close to someone, whether or not there\u2019s no protective mask you have, whether or not the whole range of things."

The part of the service that I\u2019m a part of, the paratransit side, we transport disabled and senior citizens here in our community. Most of them have underlying conditions and that makes them a big risk of potentially passing from this COVID-19. So that\u2019s a concern for us. It\u2019s a concern for our fixed route drivers as well because the same applies for them. A lot of them have grown up here in the Grand Rapids area and they\u2019re transporting the passengers that have to get to the doctor\u2019s office, to the grocery store, and they\u2019re even transporting some of the other essential workers that have to get where they need to be so that they can do their job as well."

I hope that each of you and all of your families are staying safe and healthy in these difficult days, because we need you badly. And I promise you, I promise you, what I start off, the way I look at every problem is how does it affect my neighborhood? How does affect my family? How does it affect your family? How does it affect the people I grew up with every single day? This is about us. It\u2019s not about an individual, it\u2019s about all of us."

And so I really appreciate you for having this conversation. Even as we bring this in for closing, Vice President, we\u2019re going to ask you to make some closing remarks. I just want to make it clear that, it\u2019s really clear Vice President, that President Trump has been negligent in his response to this crisis. He\u2019s failed, as you know, during the critical time and now people are dying because of it and families are hurting. He didn\u2019t want to recommend social distancing or shut down the economic activity, and because he denied the gravity of this pandemic, we\u2019re paying the price of his [inaudible 00:44:48], and the president has promised us two kits, test kits. But Vice President, test kits that are sorely needed and yet he\u2019s failed to deliver them."

I know for a fact you, Vice President Biden, who I\u2019ve known for quite some time, you are about to do that. And you served our country alongside President Obama and led a nationwide recovery after one of the worst economic recession in America, and you\u2019ve led with empathy, Vice President, and managed national responses through past epidemics, minimizing lives lost and driving us to quickly recover. It\u2019s clear who we need in The White House. And here\u2019s where I know for a fact, Vice President Biden, come November, I believe that Americans will see the Democratic Party as a vehicle to implement positive changes. And I look forward to your victory then, sir. And I\u2019ve been on your bandwagon on day one, and I\u2019m going to ride with you to the final day until we can say that Vice President Joe Biden is the next president of the United States. And so I thank you for this opportunity, and I opened this up for you if you have any closing remarks, Vice President."

My hope, my prayer is that he understands that in the midst of a pandemic like this, it\u2019s never a problem, acting quickly. It\u2019s only when you act too slowly. It\u2019s not a problem listening to science. It\u2019s only when you don\u2019t listen to it. It\u2019s not a problem taking responsibility because it gives people confidence. You know, when the president says things that are not accurate about the pandemic and people believe it and then it turns out not to be true, it just further lowers public confidence, and the American people need to have confidence right now and to know what the path is. And it\u2019s hard to figure out what this path is all the way down the road."

Tell them what you know and what you don\u2019t know, and what you think we\u2019re going to have to do. They\u2019re strong, they\u2019re courageous, they\u2019re brave, and they\u2019re willing to do whatever needs to be done to get through it, but they need to have confidence that you\u2019re telling them all that you know, and you\u2019re laying out the facts.\u201d That\u2019s the most important thing."

We got to level with them though, so I just hope the president has learned the lessons. We all make mistakes, learn the lessons, how he started off this whole thing, and begins to act in a way now that\u2019s different than he\u2019s acted in the past six months.
