But the governor of Ohio asked the presidential campaigns to cancel their indoor public events in Cleveland with large, large crowds of people and that\u2019s what we did, due to the coronavirus and he was concerned about that. And as I\u2019ve said all along that we would follow the guidance of the CDC, state and local officials and public health officials with respect to our campaign events. We\u2019ll continue to do that. This is a matter \u2026 this whole coronavirus issue as a matter of presidential leadership, and later this week I\u2019ll be speaking to you on what I believe the nation should be doing to address this virus. But tonight, I want to speak to you from Philadelphia, where we announced our campaign at the front end, where we did our final announcement. To all those who have been knocked down, to all those have been counted out, left behind, this is your campaign. Just over a week ago, many of the pundits declared that this candidacy was dead. Now we\u2019re very much alive."

With victories in Mississippi, Missouri, Michigan, and we\u2019re waiting to hear from North Dakota, Idaho, and Washington State. As I said from the beginning, this election is the one that has character on the ballot. The character of the candidates, the character of the nation is on the ballot. It\u2019s more than a comeback in my view, our campaign. It\u2019s a comeback for the soul of this nation. This campaign is taking off and I believe we\u2019re going to do well from this point on. Take nothing for granted. I want to earn every single vote in every single state, but if you\u2019re willing, if you want to join us, go to JoeBiden.com, sign up, volunteer and contribute if you can."

We share a common goal and together we\u2019ll defeat Donald Trump. We\u2019ll defeat him together. We\u2019re going to bring this nation together. We\u2019re regenerating a democratic base, the Democratic Party, the African American community, high school educated folks, like the ones I grew up with in Claymont, not far from here in my old neighborhood, labor, suburban women, veterans, firefighters, union members and so many more. People of every economic station, the poor who are struggling and they are struggling in this environment. The middle class worries about whether or not they\u2019re going to be able to hang on and stay there, maintain their economic security. They\u2019re the reason Jill and I got involved in this campaign in the first place and they\u2019re the reason why I became a Democrat so long ago."

And the way they turned out to vote for me. My first campaign when I was a kid, long time ago, I had a billboard that said one thing on it, had a picture, my wife and children and it said \u201cFor all our families,\u201d that\u2019s all it was, \u201cFor all our families.\u201d That included democratic families, families of independent voters, republican families, everyone of every stripe, for all our families. And look, that\u2019s what we\u2019re able to accomplish in South Carolina. That\u2019s what we did on Super Tuesday and it appears, almost a little premature, it appears that\u2019s what we\u2019re able to do tonight."

Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar, Beto O\u2019Rourke, Mike Bloomberg, Cory Booker, and Kamala Harris. Together, together we\u2019re bringing this party together. That\u2019s what we have to do. Tonight, we are a step closer to restoring decency, dignity and honor to the White House. That\u2019s our ultimate goal. And at this moment when there\u2019s so much fear in the country and there\u2019s so much fear across the world, we need American leadership. We need presidential leadership that\u2019s honest, trusted, truthful, and steady, reassuring leadership. If I\u2019m given the honor of becoming your president, I promise you I\u2019ll strive to give the nation that very leadership every day, every day I have a privilege to hold office. That\u2019s the reason why I\u2019m running for president. I believe we\u2019re in an incredible moment in American history, a phenomenal opportunity to deliver a bold, progressive vision to the American people. Guaranteeing that every American has healthcare, affordable healthcare, total healthcare, not a privilege but a right."

Providing every child access to good education regardless of their zip code, to deal with the moral depravity of our children who have to learn as they go to school, little children to duck and cover, zigzag down a hallway because they fear someone with a semiautomatic weapon may be coming in. We have to stand up to the gun manufacturers and to the NRA and I will do it. We have to rebuild the middle class, we have to rebuild the middle class and this time bring everybody along, everybody along. My fellow Americans, we have to once again lead the world. Donald Trump\u2019s America First policies made America alone. And the fight against climate change, we have to rally the rest of the world to act and act now. Rejoin the Paris Climate Accord on day one. Make it clear to our allies that we\u2019ll honor our commitments, that our word can be trusted. And make clear to our adversaries that we will stand fast in restoring world order. That\u2019s the American responsibility."

The Declaration of Independence, \u201cWe hold these truths to be self evident.\u201d Those words became the American creed known around the world. The U.S. Constitution, \u201cWe the people.\u201d These words literally changed the world. We\u2019ve never fully lived up to the promise of either of those documents, but we\u2019ve never ever before walked away from them. They\u2019re a reminder of what\u2019s at stake in this election. Our very democracy is at stake in this election. As I said from the moment I announced, not far from here, but I believe we\u2019re in the battle for the soul of this nation. With Donald Trump as president, our core values are standing in the world, our very democracy, everything that has made America America is truly at stake."

We can\u2019t let that happen, but winning means, but winning means uniting America, not sowing more division and anger. It means having a president who not only knows how to fight, but knows how to heal. It means, replacing a president who demeans and demonizes people with a president who believes in empathy, compassion, and respect for everyone. It is my hope that the days of divisiveness will soon be over. We\u2019re a decent, brave, resilient people. We are better than this moment we\u2019re in. What we have to do, we just need, we just need to remember who we are. This is the United States of America. There\u2019s not a single thing we cannot do if we do it together. We\u2019re on close to the eve of Saint Patrick\u2019s Day. I thought of a quote. Some of you heard me quote many times. A fellow that I admired very much who passed away not long ago, a poet named Seamus Heaney. He wrote a poem called, The Cure at Troy."

The power to make hope in history rhyme. That\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do. God bless you all. And may God protect [inaudible 00:11:14]."
