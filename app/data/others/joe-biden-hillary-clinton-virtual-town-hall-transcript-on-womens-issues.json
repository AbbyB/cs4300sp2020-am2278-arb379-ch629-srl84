There had to be transparency. And so, the interesting thing that really bothers me with this president, when they passed the Cares Act, there's a lot of good things in it, he essentially eliminated the inspector general. There's virtually no transparency. We should know exactly where every single dollar went. Even some of the big corporations who got money said, whoa, wait a minute. I didn't know. I wasn't supposed to get it. Some have given it back, ten, 15 million dollars there giving them. And they are billion dollar corporations. And so, you see that happening.

We fix it. A lot of people hurt. All those lost lives are never going to come back. And there's going to be a hole in the hearts of millions of families out there. But we always come back and we come back stronger. We come back stronger and we end up in a better place than before it all happened. So, what do you think we should be focusing on?

Even when we had the test, which we don't sufficiently, people who have access are worried to go get the test because they're going to be charged. They believe that, so it has to be cost free and the treatment cost fee. No one should have to pay a dollar out of pocket for that. Now, I've called for that on March the 12th and it should be part of the next congressional package, I hope. The next thing I would do is help laid off workers to ensure they could keep their health insurance through COBRA. Meaning that if their health insurance is provided by their company, which they pay into, it's really expensive for most families to make up the difference. There's a thing called COBRA, you can keep that insurance. If the company can no longer pay their share, you make up the difference.",

And if you don't have employer sponsored insurance, we should immediately reopen what's called the open enrollment so they can sign up for coverage and create an affordable public option that we can do through the Affordable Care Act, which the president is still trying to eliminate right as we speak. And finally, we need to ensure that women have access to all health services during this crisis. Abortion is an essential health healthcare service. It's being used as a political wedge right now and it shouldn't be. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association agree that it shouldn't be categorized as a procedure that can be delayed. It can't. And in this case, healthcare delayed means healthcare denied. States should not be using public health crises to infringe on a women's constitutional rights.

God love Paul Ryan he set out to do that and the president hadn't given up on that cause and the cause is what we should be doing right now is a lot of our senior workers who are very old need an additional, an additional amount of social security now during this crisis.",

You're absolutely right and when you mentioned social security I have long advocated and I know you agree that we need to fix the disadvantage that women unfortunately bear under social security because when you take time out to care for children or an ailing spouse or ailing parents you're out of the workforce and you don't get the credit that you need to be able to have a more secure retirement when that becomes possible. So, the social security system, Medicare, they should not be in the bullseye target of this president and all of his plutocratic allies they need to be helped, to be strengthened and improved so that they actually do provide the quality of care that they should be and the amount of income that they should be offering.",

We've got to fix our systems friends. I mean we've just moved along on top of them trying to protect what we had against the concerted relentless effort by too many on the other side to rip away what we did have. But now if we get people to pay attention and to really look at what's at stake for them, for their families, then I think we can have an election that really will matter about how we put us on a stronger foundation for the future and I'm thrilled to be here with Joe today.",

I think it was close to eight or nine specific times resulting in some of those folks in the intelligence community either being fired or just going underground I mean not being paid attention to it at all.

The question is did he just not read his, what we used to call the PDB or did he read it and not care? I presume to give him the more generous view that he just didn't read it which is a totally ungenerous view I mean but I can't fathom it.
