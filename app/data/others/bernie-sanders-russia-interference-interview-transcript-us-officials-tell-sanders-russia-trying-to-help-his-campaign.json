Whether Trump recognizes that or not or acknowledges or not, they did interfere in 2016. The intelligence community is telling us they are interfering in this campaign right now in 2020, and when I say to Mr. Putin if elected president, trust me, you are not going to be interfering in American elections."

We were told that Russia, maybe other countries are going to get involved in this campaign and look, here\u2019s the message to Russia. Stay out of American elections. And what they are doing by the way, the ugly thing that they are doing, and I\u2019ve seen some of the tweets and stuff, is they tried to divide us up. That\u2019s what they did in 2016. That is the ugliest thing they are doing is they are trying to cause chaos, they\u2019re trying to cause hatred in America. It\u2019s an ugly business and all of us have got to say, \u201cSorry, you\u2019re not going to do this in this election.\u201d And again, as president of the United States, Mr. Putin, you will not interfere in our elections."
