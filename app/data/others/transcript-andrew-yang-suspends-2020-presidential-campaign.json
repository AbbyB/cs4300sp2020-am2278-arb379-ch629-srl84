Thank you so much. New Hampshire and everyone who supported this campaign, thank you for everything you\u2019ve done to make this campaign possible over these past months. You all have uplifted me, and inspired me and Evelyn, and this campaign at every turn. Your passion and energy, your donations, and hundreds of thousands of hours calling, volunteering, your enthusiasm, dedication, and commitment. We\u2019ve accomplished so much together."

One of the things I\u2019m most proud of, we gave $1,000 a month to 13 families around the country, including [inaudible 00:06:19] right here in New Hampshire."

We stood on the debate stage, and shifted our national conversation to include the 4th Industrial Revolution, a topic no one wanted to touch until we made it happen here with this campaign."

Without a doubt, we accelerated the eradication of poverty in our society by years, even generations, and that is thanks to all of you who are here tonight. Thousands of voters came out for our campaign tonight. Tonight is not the outcome we fought so hard to achieve. It is bitterly disappointing for many of us, but it shouldn\u2019t be. Every single day I\u2019ve been campaigning, I\u2019ve had supporters say to me, \u201cYour campaign helped me out of a depression. Thank you."
