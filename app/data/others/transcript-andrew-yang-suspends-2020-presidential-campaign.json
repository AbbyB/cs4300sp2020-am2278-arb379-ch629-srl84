I love you and appreciate you so much, baby. Thank you so much. New Hampshire and everyone who supported this campaign, thank you for everything you've done to make this campaign possible over these past months. You all have uplifted me, and inspired me and Evelyn, and this campaign at every turn. Your passion and energy, your donations, and hundreds of thousands of hours calling, volunteering, your enthusiasm, dedication, and commitment. We've accomplished so much together. We have brought a message of humanity first, and a vision of an economy and society that works for us, and our families to millions of our fellow Americans. We went from a mailing list that started with just my Gmail contact list, to receiving donations from over 400,000 people around the country, and millions more who've supported this campaign. One of the things I'm most proud of, we gave $1,000 a month to 13 families around the country, including [inaudible 00:06:19] right here in New Hampshire. We highlighted the real problems in our communities as our economy is being transformed before our eyes by technology, and automation. Americans know now that when you go to a factory in Michigan, you do not find wall-to-wall immigrants doing work. You find wall-to-wall robot arms and machines doing the work that people used to do. We stood on the debate stage, and shifted our national conversation to include the 4th Industrial Revolution, a topic no one wanted to touch until we made it happen here with this campaign. Our signature proposal, universal basic income has become part of the mainstream conversation. We increased the popular support for universal basic income to 66% of Democrats, and 72% among voters, 18 to 34. Without a doubt, we accelerated the eradication of poverty in our society by years, even generations, and that is thanks to all of you who are here tonight. Thousands of voters came out for our campaign tonight. Tonight is not the outcome we fought so hard to achieve. It is bitterly disappointing for many of us, but it shouldn't be. Every single day I've been campaigning, I've had supporters say to me, “Your campaign helped me out of a depression. Thank you. Working on this campaign has made me a better person. I met my significant other because of you. Your campaign brought my family together. Your campaign got me excited about politics for the first time.” These are all things that people have said to me in the past days, and they are the reasons why I am so incredibly proud of this campaign, and what we've accomplished together. We have touched and improved millions of lives, and moved this country we love so much in the right direction, and while there is great work left to be done, I am the math guy and it is clear tonight from the numbers that we are not going to win this race. I am not someone who wants to accept donations and support in a race that we will not win, and so tonight, I am announcing, I am suspending my campaign for president. I love you too, thank you [inaudible 00:09:34]. Thank you so much.",

Endings are hard in New Hampshire, but this is not an ending. This is a beginning. This is just the starting line.

The Yang Gang has fundamentally shifted the direction of this country, and transformed our politics, and we are only continuing to grow. I'd like to thank my incredible staff, and the hundreds of people who left their lives and their jobs to join and build this campaign. I know what a risk that was. Very few people joined this campaign because they thought it was going to be a good career move, so thank you. Thank you to my team. My goal when I first started running was to solve the problems that got Donald Trump elected. In order to do that, I will support whoever is the democratic nominee. That said, I hope this campaign can be a message, and a word of caution and guidance to my democratic colleagues that Donald Trump is not the cause of all of our problems. He is a symptom of a disease that has been building up in our communities for years. We must cure the disease that got him elected, and in order to do that, we must address the real problems that affect our people, and offer solutions to actually solve them. I stand before you tonight, and say that while we did not win this election, we are just getting started. This is the beginning, this movement is the future of American politics, this movement is the future of the Democratic Party.",
