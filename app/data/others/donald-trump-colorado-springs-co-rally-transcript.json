We are doing better than any country in the world, that is not even close. And we\u2019ve rebuilt our military over the last three years. Don\u2019t tell anybody, but we spent two and a half trillion dollars. But when it comes to our military and our safety and our security, we don\u2019t worry about budgets, right? We don\u2019t worry about budgets. We had to rebuild it. It was depleted. It was in bad shape. It was old, it was tired. We have the best people in the world, but they had old equipment. Now we have brand new jets. We have brand new missiles and rockets. We have everything all made in the USA. In my State of the Union Address, I proudly declared that we are in the midst of the great American comeback. That\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. Our country is stronger today than ever before. After three years of ridiculous witch hunts and scams and partisan Democrat crusades, the radical left\u2019s attempt to poison our democracy and overturn this last election have totally failed. They have been a complete flop and we today have the highest poll numbers we\u2019ve ever had today, just came out."

It\u2019s all right. Mini mike. How about Klobuchar, did you see her? She choked. She choked. She couldn\u2019t breathe. Alfred E.

Because that\u2019s really what he was doing, but he doesn\u2019t want to say that. No, how about that? \u201cAre you saying I\u2019m dumb?\u201d That was the end of her campaign in my book. You don\u2019t say that. Even if it\u2019s true, you don\u2019t say that. They had a crazy person on today on one of the Fox shows. I tell you, Fox doesn\u2019t treat us the way they used to. But we have the great Sean Hannity, we do, and we have Laura and Tucker. And we have in the morning Fox and Friends, Steve and Ainsley, and Brian\u2019s gotten much better, he\u2019s moving up. And we have the great Lou Dobbs. Lou Dobbs says he\u2019s the greatest president ever. The great Lou Dobbs. He says, Lou Dobbs a year and a half, two years ago he said, \u201cHe\u2019s the greatest since Reagan.\u201d Then he said about six months ago, \u201cHe\u2019s better than Reagan.\u201d And then he said a few nights ago, \u201cHe\u2019s the greatest we\u2019ve ever had.\u201d I said, \u201cDoes that include Lincoln and George Washington?\u201d He said, \u201cThat includes them all.\u201d That\u2019s Lou Dobbs. The great Lou Dobbs. And you\u2019ve got Hegseth and you\u2019ve got Jesse Waters. How about Jesse? And Judge Jeanine and even Greg Gutfeld. Greg hated us, right? But now he says, \u201cLook, whether I like him or not, he gets it done. It\u2019s all about getting it done.\u201d We\u2019re getting it done. Nobody\u2019s ever done what we\u2019ve done. No, but Fox says, and I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s different. It was different. In the old days, it was better for us. It was better for us. But it\u2019s okay, we\u2019ll win anyway."

We put it in and it was just getting set, and we got hit with a tornado of wind and it blew it down, and the fake news said Trump\u2019s wall fell down. It was blown down. But see, at least we have a voice where we can explain. It\u2019s true. We lifted it up and we held it up. When the storm went by, we had it set and it\u2019s set beautifully, and the following day, that sucker is going to be up for many, many years. Can you imagine?"
