For real. I had to wait 17 days to be constitutionally-eligible to be sworn in. I\u2019m the first United States Senator I ever knew, Lieutenant Governor, the first one I ever knew.

If you take a look, the only presidents who\u2019ve ever beaten an incumbent president in this century are, the Democrats, were Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton and Barack Obama.

We had the Spanish speaking community in my state, whereas people that the president does not even understand are Americans, Puerto Ricans. No, he really didn\u2019t. It was just bizarre.
