Tonight I want to take the opportunity to express my appreciation and respect for all of the Democratic candidates we ran against. Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar, Elizabeth Warren, Joe Biden. What I can tell you with absolute certainty, and I know I speak for everyone of the Democratic candidates, is that no matter who wins, and we certainly hope it's going to be us, we're going to unite together … We are going to unite together and defeat the most dangerous president in the modern history of this country. The reason I believe we are going to win is that we have an unprecedented grassroots movement from coast to coast of millions of people. The reason that we are going to win is that we are putting together an unprecedented multi generational, multi racial political movement. This is a movement from coast to coast, which is demanding that we finally have an economy and a government that works for all of us, not wealthy campaign contributors. I want to thank all of those people who have worked and contributed to our campaign, but make the point that in this point in the campaign we are taking on billionaires and we're taking on candidates funded by billionaires. But we are going to win because we have the agenda that speaks to the needs of working people throughout this country. Healthcare is a human right not a privilege. The wealthy and powerful will start paying their fair share of taxes. We will make public colleges and universities tuition free, and cancel all student debt. Unlike Donald Trump we know that climate change is very real and an existential crisis for our planet. We are prepared to tell the fossil fuel industry that they're short-term profits are not more important than the future of our planet.",

          "text": "Hello New Hampshire. The results are still coming in from across the state, but right now it is clear that Senator Sanders and Mayor Buttigieg had strong nights and I also want to congratulate my friend and colleague, Amy Klobuchar for showing just how wrong the pundits can be when they count a woman out. Since we are here tonight among family and friends, I also want us to be honest with ourselves as Democrats, we might be headed for another one of those long primary fights that lasts for months. We're two States in, with 55 States and territories to go. We still have 98% of our delicate for our nomination up for grabs and Americans in every part of the country are going to make their voices heard. That's right. The question for us Democrats is whether it will be a long bitter rehash of the same old divides in our party or whether we can find another way. Senator Sanders and Mayor Buttigieg are both great people and either one of them would be a far better president than Donald Trump. I respect them both. But the fight between factions in our party has taken a sharp turn in recent weeks with ads mocking other candidates and with supporters of some candidates shouting curses at other democratic candidates. These harsh tactics might work if you are willing to burn down the rest of the party in order to be the last man standing. They might work, if you don't worry about leaving our party and our politics worse off than how you found it, and they might work if you think only you have all the answers and only you are the solution to all our problems. But if we're going to beat Donald Trump in November, we are going to need huge turnout within our party and to get that turnout, we will need a nominee that the broadest coalition of our party feels like they can get behind. We cannot afford to fall into factions. We can't afford to squander our collective power. We win when we come together. The Reverend Jesse Jackson once said, “It takes two wings to fly,” and I think he's right. Our campaign is best positioned to beat Donald Trump in November because we can unite our party. We can unite this party and this country by mobilizing people behind ideas that are not only popular with huge majorities of the American people, but that also accomplish structural change for our broken government and our rigged economy. We can unite people around the wealth tax on the very richest Americans so we can invest in education for all our children. We can unite people around ending corruption in Washington, ending the corruption that has met stagnant wages, rising costs, and a tighter and tighter squeeze on the middle class. We can do that. Ending corruption that leaves more and more working families with less and less hope for a better future, and that has crushed people of color even harder. Ending the corruption that has shortchanged our kids, our schools and the very survival of the planet, they will inherit. Families in America today are running out of time. We have faced decades of shrinking opportunity, decades of rising inequality, decades of a widening racial wealth gap. Big business has captured and use government to serve its own interests at the expense of smaller businesses and the expense of the American people. I believe in markets, but markets without rules are theft. Market without rules perpetuate racial discrimination. For too long the rules have been rigged against people who just want a level playing field. 2020 is our time to change who makes the rules. Now, it was never my plan to run for office of any kind. Well, good. But not my plan and I have been in this fight though, this fight for working families for decades. I fought credit card companies as they tried to trick and track consumers. I fought our own banking regulators to hold them accountable during the financial crash. I fought to build a new federal agency to protect consumers from predatory financial institutions. I got in this fight, I ran for office because I saw that families were being squeezed harder than ever and too many politicians were not getting enough done. I'm here to get big things done. Because here's the thing about politicians, whether they're offering vague platitudes or powerful rhetoric, they will ultimately face the same test, actually getting anything done in a Washington that is badly broken. Americans from all political backgrounds don't need a bunch of flowery words to explain this. They know deep down in their bones exactly why government doesn't work for them. It's corruption and we need to call it out for what it is. The corruption that gives lobbyists a louder voice than voters. The corruption that lets big companies pay nothing in taxes while small businesses pay full freight. The corruption that ensures that nothing ever changes on done violence or climate policy or drug prices, even though nearly everyone in America wants change. Let's be specific here, on a day when career prosecutors showed more backbone than almost every Republican Senator standing up to this president. Americans of all political strikes are gravely concerned about the corruption of a Trump justice department that abandons the rule of law to give sweetheart deals to criminals who commit their crimes on behalf of Donald Trump. And yes, Roger Stone, I'm looking at you. Yes. [inaudible 00:09:01]. Tonight I have a message for our party and for this nation. Our best chance of beating Donald Trump is with a candidate who can do the work. And I mean the hard disciplined work. A candidate who can build a campaign to unite our party and a candidate who can build a movement that is ready to take on corruption and win. You guys so great. The only way we can take on corruption in Washington is if we're not beholden to it. Let's just check the facts. Amy and I are the only candidates in this race who are not either billionaires or supported by super packs. Unlike other candidates, I don't fund my campaign by spending time behind closed doors, sucking up to wealthy donors. Our movement is powered by you. It is powered by people. Over the past year I've had the chance to shake hands or hug way over a 100,000 people in more than 220 town halls in 29 States in Puerto Rico, and you know, there are a lot of differences among us. We come from different backgrounds, different religions, languages and experiences. We have different dreams and different aspirations. We feel the urgency of this moment in different ways, but with all of those glorious differences, for the most part, we want the same things. We want an America where decisions in Washington aren't bought and paid for by lobbyists and big donors. We want an America where every person has a voice in our democracy. We want an America where fossil fuel companies don't have a vice grip on our planet. An America where we can breathe the air and drink the water. An America where every child can dream big and actually have a chance to make it. Because no matter the color of your skin, who you love, how you worship or what zip code you live in, you deserve America where you are safe and your opportunities are just as good as anyone else's. You are amazing. I can see that America, that America is within our reach, and if you can imagine that America, if you think it's worth fighting for, then join us. Go to elizabethwarren.com right now, pitch in a few bucks. Sign up to volunteer, get involved with our campaign. This moment will not come our way again. So tonight- Tonight, I'm here to say thank you. Thank you to every volunteer. Thank you to every organizer, to every door knocker to every forward and banker for every $5 donor. Thank you. Thank you for helping build a movement to take back our democracy and to rebuild it from the grassroots up. While I'm thanking everyone, I want to take just a moment… Where are you… to thank my sweetie Bruce. I also want to thank the good boy who posed for one selfie after another, our baby. The fight we're in, the fight to save our democracy is an uphill battle, but our campaign is built for the long haul, and we are just getting started. I am grateful down to my toes for what our campaign has been able to accomplish so far. My plans for this country have been influenced by letters pressed into my palms by little girls. My will to fight has been strengthened by the people who have whispered their dreams in my ears. My determination to lead a movement has been forged by the tens of thousands of people who have said they are ready to fight for an America they know we can be. Because if we have the hope that comes with dreaming big, if we have the courage to fight hard, we are going to win. Thank you.",

We also know better than to try to defeat such a disruptive president by relying on the same Washington framework and mindset. After all, if today's Washington were serving America well, a guy like Donald Trump would never have come within cheating distance of the Oval Office in the first place. So to win and to govern, we need to bring new voices to our capital. We need to get Washington starting to work more like our best run cities and towns, rather than the other way around. I know that when you talk this way, you might get dismissed as a naive newcomer. But a fresh outlook is what makes new beginnings possible. It is how we build a new majority.

The best way to earn the White House and the best way to unify this country. The answers, they lie in a vision that brings Americans together not only in the knowledge of what we must stand against, but in the confidence of knowing what we are for. This is the powerful majority we are gathering together. From Davenport to Dover, from Carson City to Columbia, it is a coalition of addition, not subtraction. It is a movement reaching into church basements and barbershops, into universities and union halls, carrying the same values with us everywhere we go. We saw that coalition awakening. We saw it tonight in cities and suburbs from the seacoast to those industrial towns too often left behind. Together we are building a future where there will be no such thing as an uninsured American or an unaffordable prescription. That's what we can deliver with a plan most Americans can get behind. Medicare for all who want it, ensuring care for every American, but trusting you to choose whether you want it and when you want it. Together we will stop enabling corporate greed and start raising wages. Empowering workers and making good on the idea that one job ought to be enough.",

Together we can build that American experience defined by belonging. We can say to a young woman in a hijab enduring taunts because of her religion, to a young man feeling fear instead of safety when he spots the lights of a police vehicle, we can say, “You belong securely in the heart of the American project.” We can show people of every religion and of no religion that this country belongs to you equally, and practice a politics that insists that God does not belong to a political party. We can tell an autoworker, thrown around by tectonic shifts in our economy, that yes, our economic future has a place for you and we need you in it.

I cannot wait to build a movement, and win with a movement of fired up Democrats, of independents, and moderate Republicans that see this election as we do. We see it as an economic check on this president. We see it as a patriotism check. We see it as a decency check. Because in the end, we know that what unites us is so much bigger than what divides us. We know that we believe, so many of us believe that the heart of America is bigger than the heart of this guy in the White House. Tonight is about grit. My story, like so many of yours, is one of resilience. I announced my candidacy in the middle of a Minnesota blizzard. There were a lot of people that predicted I wouldn't even get through that speech, but not the people of my state and not the people of New Hampshire. Except then they predicted that we wouldn't make it through the summer. We did. Then they predicted we wouldn't make it to the debates. Man, were we at the debate in New Hampshire. What we've been is steady, we've been strong, and we've never quit. I think that sounds pretty good for a president. But across the months and months and miles of this race, we redefined the word grit. You see it with our happy, scrappy campaign. You saw it in our 10 county, 30 hour tour in the middle of a nor'easter. Let's not forget that. You saw it in our early morning diner stops on our late night rallies. And yes, you saw it on that debate stage. Just like so many of you out there, I know a little bit about resilience. My grandpa worked 1,500 feet underground in the mines in Northern Minnesota. He never graduated from high school because his parents were sick, he had nine brothers and sisters, and he had to help raise them. Every day he would go down in that cage in that mine, carrying a lunch bucket that my grandma would pack. His youngest sister, Hannah, was only eight years old when they put her in an orphanage. He vowed after his parents died that he would go and get her. Two years later, he borrowed a car, he went to Duluth, and he brought her home. He and my grandma saved money in a coffee can in their basement to send my dad to a two-year community college. My dad then became a newspaper man. My mom, she was born in Milwaukee, the site of our next convention. She came to Minnesota and taught second grade until she was 70 years old. I still meet people that say she was their favorite teacher. So I stand before you today as a granddaughter of an iron ore miner, as a daughter of a teacher and a newspaper man, as the first woman elected to the US Senate from the state of Minnesota, and a candidate for president of the United States. That, my friends, that is because we live in a country of shared dreams. That no matter where you come from, no matter who you know, no matter the color of your skin, no matter where you worship, no matter who you love, that you can make it in the United States of America. I didn't have a perfect life. My dad struggled with alcoholism his whole life. By the time John and I got married, he got his third DWI. Then the judge said to him, “You've got to decide, jail or treatment,” and he chose treatment. In his words, he was pursued by grace. I believe that everyone in this country should have that opportunity to be pursued by grace. When Abigail was born, we thought it was going to be this perfect thing, but she was really sick and she couldn't swallow and she was in intensive care. Back then, the insurance companies had a rule and they kicked me out of the hospital even though she was in intensive care in 24 hours. A few months later, I went to the legislature, worked with a number of legislators, and we passed one of the first laws in the country guaranteeing new moms and their babies a 48 hour hospital stay. That's how I do my work. As my friend, Elizabeth, noted earlier tonight, people told me, just like they told her, that they didn't think a woman could be elected. In my case, it was elected to the US Senate. No woman had ever done it before. But I came back, I defied expectations, and I won. I have done it over and over again in the reddest of red districts and the bluest of blue districts. When I got to the US Senate, people told me, “It's so hard to get things done.” Well, in that gridlock of Washington, DC, I have passed over 100 bills as a lead Democrat, because I did not give up. And tonight in New Hampshire, as everyone had counted us out even a week ago, thank you, pundits, I came back and we delivered. We have been on quite a journey together, and you've learned this about me, I never give up. But my story is nothing compared to the resilience that I've seen all over this country. The mom in California, who lost her child to gun violence. And even through her grief and heartbreak, she has joined the fight to keep our children safe. The immigrant who works two jobs and still struggles to put food on the table, but is determined to raise her kids in America so that they have a better future. The farmer who's facing bankruptcy because of bad Trump policies, but persists in working the land just like his parents and his grandparents before him. America deserves a president who doesn't give up or give in, just because a decision is hard. America deserves a president who is as resilient as her people. America deserves a president who's going to take on the challenges of our time, climate change, and affordable education, and college, immigration reform, justice, and democracy, and yes, bringing down the cost of healthcare. Our country cannot take another four years of Donald Trump. The rule of law can't withstand another four years of a president who thinks that he is above it. Our collective sense of decency can't handle another four years of a president who doesn't care about it. Our democracy can't tolerate another four years of a president who wants to bulldoze right through it. And our American dream cannot tolerate a president that thinks he can choose who lives it. The president might as well have a sign on his desk that says, “The buck stops anywhere but here.” He literally, he blames everyone. He blames… Think about this. For anything that goes wrong, he blames Barack Obama. He blames the city of Baltimore. He blames the head of the Federal Reserve that he appointed. He blames the energy secretary that he nominated. He blames the city of Baltimore. He blames the entire kingdom of Denmark. Who does that? My favorite recent one, he blames the prime minister of Canada for cutting him out of the Canadian version of Home Alone 2. That's what this guy does. That is Donald Trump. I think we can do better. Because for the people of this country, when things go wrong, they don't have anyone to blame. They just have to pick themselves up. I can promise you this. When I am behind that desk, I will take responsibility instead of passing it on. I will reach across the aisle and work with Americans in good faith, instead of picking fights. I will bring this country together instead of tearing it apart. Some of you have heard the story about Franklin Delano Roosevelt. He was beloved. When he died, they put his body in a train and it went through the countryside to Washington, DC. People would spontaneously stand next to those rail tracks to show their respect. The story goes that one guy was standing there sobbing. Regular guy. Had his hat across his chest. This reporter says to him, “Sir, did you know President Roosevelt? Do you mind me asking, did you know him?” And the guy says, “No, I didn't know President Roosevelt, but he knew me. He knew me.” That is what's lacking right now in the White House. That empathy, that ability of a president to put himself or herself in the shoes of the people of this country. What is lacking is that sacred trust between the people of this nation and the president of the United States. My friends, I will restore that trust. If you are having trouble deciding between filling a prescription or filling your refrigerator with food, I know you and I will fight for you. If you cannot decide how you're going to stretch that paycheck to pay for your rent or pay your mortgage, I know you and I will fight for you. If you are having trouble deciding how are you going to pay for the childcare for your kids and the long-term care for your parents, I know you and I will fight for you. If you want a democratic nominee who can make our tent bigger, who can make our coalition wider, and our coattails longer, I know you and I will fight for you. If you feel stuck in the extremes of our politics and you are tired of the noise and the nonsense, you have a home with me. If you want a nominee who can stand up to Donald Trump on that debate stage, which you well know I can do, I need your votes, yes. And I'm going to need those votes of the people in Nevada, yes. And I'm going to need the votes in South Carolina and beyond. But most of all, I need your hearts. I don't have that big bank account. I don't have that big name as some of the other people that are in this race. And I am not a newcomer with no political record. But what I do is get things done. What I have is your back. So I ask you to join us at AmyKlobuchar.com. Join our campaign. Join our campaign. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, New Hampshire. We are on to Nevada because the best is yet to come. Now, I want to thank a few people before we start the music and everything, who have been here with me in New Hampshire from the very beginning. I am so proud to have their help and support. It has meant the world. First of all, my great state director, Scott Merrick. Right over here. And my campaign manager and our team, Justin Buoen. And our team up here and all the incredible staff in New Hampshire that beat the odds when everyone counted us out, you never did. And then I want to thank the incredible group of endorsers. So many legislators and former legislators and mayors and local officials that I can't name all of them, but I will name a few. Councilor Debora Pignatelli. Thank you, Debora. Debora Pignatelli who is so well-respected, introduced me up here today. Thank you. Joe Foster, the former attorney general of New Hampshire, right over there. State senators Jay Kahn and Jeanne Diestch. Thank you to both of you. Former brigadier general, Kevin Ryan, as well as Ambassador Jim Smith, who barnstormed the state for us. The amazing state House leaders, Karen Ebel. Thank you, Karen, wherever you are. Lucy Weber and Doug Ley. And two special mayors I wanted to mention because I saw them the last few days. Caroline McCarley of Rochester, and Andrew… Where are you, Andrew of Laconia? Right over there. There you are. Thank you. Also, people who have been there and given me so much guidance and advice, Rich Siegel. Thank you so much. Ricia McMahon, thank you. Michael Atkins, Jim Callahan, Tom Silvia, and Karen Cornelius. I want to thank all of you. We are so excited. We're going to take this show on the road with all of this great New Hampshire goodwill. The best is yet to come. Let's get to work, everyone.
