We don\u2019t talk about communities, we speak with communities. We don\u2019t act alone because we don\u2019t lead alone. Leadership is not an individual exercise.

He\u2019s delivered for public transportation. He\u2019s delivered for internet access. He\u2019s delivered to expand healthcare. And he has delivered because when the auto industry was down, President Barack Obama said send Joe Biden to Detroit. Send Joe Biden to Michigan to protect the middle class. To undergird the auto industry that is the lifeblood of our state because everybody in here either works in or loves somebody who works in the auto industry.

That\u2019s what happened in 2016, but the question is, what\u2019s different? What\u2019s different? The difference is, nobody with the record, results, and relationships of Joe Biden was on the ballot.

But I was also fighting an insurance company that was wrongfully denying my mom\u2019s chemotherapy. I have commiserated with Joe Biden about this because the brain tumor that killed my mother is the same one that took Beau Biden\u2019s life.
