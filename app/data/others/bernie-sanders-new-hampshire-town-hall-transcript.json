You\u2019re not happy about it, but you go to the doctor when you want, wrong. You got a $5,000 deductible, you got a $10,000 deductible, you got to take huge amounts of money out of your own pocket before you can walk into the doctor\u2019s office. We eliminate all deductibles. We eliminate all out of pocket expenses. These are not radical ideas. I know some people think, \u201cOh my God, how did he think of all these?\u201d This is what goes on all over the world.

So Donald Trump, in case you are watching, how are you? I want you to know that climate change is not a hoax. It is a dangerous reality. Unlike the Trump administration, our administration will listen to the scientists and what the scientists are telling us is that not only is climate change real, they have underestimated the degree and the severity in which it is ravaging this country and the planet. Polar ice caps melting at a faster rate, ocean warming at a faster rate, drought getting worse, the extreme weather disturbances getting worse. What the United Nations is telling us is that if we don\u2019t get our act together by the end of the century, they will be hundreds of millions of climate refugees.

We\u2019re not quite as divided as some would think we are. And in one issue in particular that has been a coming together of people from rural states like Vermont and New Hampshire and urban communities like Chicago and New York City, people who are gun owners and people who are not gun owners. People have seen over the last several decades with horror and disgust mass shootings and gun violence in America. And the American people want action. And they look to Washington and they say, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you doing anything?\u201d And the answer is pretty simple.

I think we have a strong shot in South Carolina and California and the states that follow. So if we win here tomorrow, I think we got a path to victory for the democratic nomination. When we win the democratic nomination, and when we put together the strongest grassroots political movement this country has ever seen, we\u2019re going to defeat Donald Trump. But we are going to do more than defeat Donald Trump. What we are going to do is begin the process of transforming this country. We are prepared with your help to take on the greed of Wall Street, the insurance companies, the drug companies, the fossil fuel industry, the military industrial complex, the prison industrial complex, and the entire 1%. With your help, we are prepared not only to defeat Trump, but to create an economy and a government that works for all of us, not just the 1%. Thank you all very much."
