Here with me on the stage tonight, NBC News Political Director and moderator of Meet the Press, Chuck Todd. And NBC News Chief White House correspondent and MSNBC anchor, Hallie Jackson. Also joining us is Telemundo’s Senior Correspondent, Vanessa Hauc. And editor of the Nevada Independent Jon Ralston, who has covered Nevada politics for more than three decades. The rules are this tonight, candidates will get a minute 15 to answer each question and 45 seconds for followups. Now that the stage has narrowed to six candidates, we encourage each of you to directly engage with each other on the issues. So let’s get to our first question. Since the last time you all shared the stage, Senator Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, has surged into the lead nationally in the democratic race. And there’s a new person on the stage tonight, Mayor Michael Bloomberg. A former Republican who spent millions of his own dollars to run in this race. What hasn’t changed? A majority of democratic voters still say their top priority is beating President Trump. Senator Sanders, the first question to you, Mayor Bloomberg is pitching himself as a centrist who says he’s best positioned to win in November. Why is your revolution a better bet?",

Mr. Bloomberg had policies in New York city of stop-and-frisk, which went after African American and Latino people in an outrageous way. That is not a way you’re going to grow voter turnout. What our movement is about is bringing working class people together, black and white and Latino, Native American, Asian American, around an agenda that works for all of us and not just the billionaire class. And that agenda says that maybe, just maybe, we should join the rest of the industrialized world, guarantee healthcare to all people as a human right, raise that minimum wage to a living wage of 15 bucks an hour. And have the guts to take on the fossil fuel industry, because their short term profits are not more important than the future of this planet and the need to combat climate change. Those are some of the reasons we have the strongest campaign to defeat Donald Trump.",

Look, I’ll support whoever the democratic nominee is, but understand this, Democrats take a huge risk if we just substitute one arrogant billionaire for another. This country has worked for the rich for a long time and left everyone else in the dirt.

But I want to say this, I actually welcomed Mayor Bloomberg to the stage. I thought that he shouldn’t be hiding behind his TV ads, and so I was already for this big day. And then I looked at the memo from his campaign staff this morning and it said that he actually thought that three of us should get out of the way. That is what his campaign said, because we should pave the way for him to become the nominee. I have been told as a woman, as someone that maybe no one thought was still going to be standing up on this stage, but I am because of pure grit and because of the people out there. I’ve been told many times to wait my turn and to step aside and I’m not going to do that now and I’m not going to do that because a campaign memo from Mayor Bloomberg said this morning that the only way that we get a nominee is if we step aside for him.

So in terms of being able to beat Donald Trump, I’m better positioned according to your poll than anybody else to beat Donald Trump, number one. Number two, the Mayor makes an interesting point. The mayor says that he has a great record, that he’s done these wonderful things. Well the fact of the matter is, he has not managed his city very, very well when he was there. He didn’t get a whole lot done. He has stop-and-frisk, throwing close to 5 million young black men up against a wall. And when we came along in our administration, President Obama and said, “We’re going to send in a mediator to stop it.” He said, “That’s unnecessary.” So we’re going to get a chance to talk about the mayor’s record, but in terms of who is best prepared to beat Donald Trump, look at your poll and what it says.",

When Mayor Bloomberg was busy blaming African Americans and Latinos for the housing crash of 2008, I was right here in Las Vegas, literally just a few blocks down the street holding hearings on the banks that were taking away homes from millions of families. That’s when I met Mr. Estrada, one of your neighbors. He came in to testify and he said he thought he’d done everything right with Wells Fargo. But what had happened? They took away his house in a matter of weeks. This man stood there and cried while he talked about what it was like to tell his two little daughters that they might not be in their elementary schools, that they might be living out of their van. I spent the next years making sure that would never happen again. Wall Street fought us every inch of the way on a consumer agency. They lost and I won.

Housekeepers, like Elizabeth and I met with last night, who have healthcare plans that have been negotiated over time, sweat and blood. And that is the truth for so many Americans right now- There are 149 million Americans that would lose their current health insurance under Senator Sanders’ bill. That’s what it says on page eight and I don’t think we should forget that.",

And yet today, despite spending twice as much per capita, Chuck, twice as much as any other major country on earth, we got 87 million who are uninsured or under insured. We got over 60,000 people who die every year because they don’t get to a doctor on time. We’re getting ripped off outrageously by the greed and corruption of the pharmaceutical industry, which in some cases charges us 10 times more for the same drugs because of their price fixing. 500,000 people go bankrupt every year because they can’t afford medical bills. So let me be very clear, to my good friends in the Culinary Workers Union, a great union, I will never sign a bill that will reduce the health care benefits they have.

It’s not a plan, it’s a PowerPoint. And Amy’s plan is even less, it’s like a Post-it Note, insert plan here. Bernie has started very much, has a good start. But instead of expanding and bringing in more people to help, instead his campaign relentlessly attacks everyone who asks a question or tries to fill in details about how to actually make this work. And then his own advisor’s say, “Eh, probably won’t happen anyway.” Look, healthcare is a crisis in this country. My approach to this is we need as much help for as many people as quickly as possible and bring in as many supporters as we can.

He said just a letter from a doctor is enough, and a lot of folks on this stage are now saying that’s enough. But I am certainly prepared to get a physical, put out the results. I think everybody here should be willing to do the same. But I’m actually less concerned about the lack of transparency on Sander’s personal health than I am about the lack of transparency on how to pay for his healthcare plan. Since he said that it’s impossible to even know how much it’s going to cost. And even after raising taxes on everybody making $29,000, there is still a multi-trillion dollar hole. Matter of fact, if you add up his policies altogether, they come to $50 trillion. He’s only explained $25 trillion worth of revenue, which means that the hole in there is bigger than the size of the entire economy of the United States.

Let’s talk about democratic socialism, not communism Mr. Bloomberg, that’s a cheap shot. Let’s talk about democratic. Let’s talk about what goes on in countries like Denmark, where Pete correctly pointed out, they have a much higher quality of life in many respects than we do. What are we talking about? We are living in many ways in a socialist society right now. Problem is, as Dr. Martin Luther King reminded us, we have socialism for the very rich, rugged individualism for the poor. Let me finish. When Donald Trump gets $800 million in tax breaks and subsidies to build luxury condominiums, that’s socialism for the rich. Walmart, we have to subsidize Walmart’s workers who are on Medicaid and food stamps because the wealthiest family in America pays starvation wages, that’s socialism for the rich. I believe in democratic socialism for working people, not billionaires, health care for all, and educational opportunities for all.",

And when I think of Dreamers and I tried to explain it to my state, I found a 99-year-old Hispanic war veteran who was a Dreamer when he was brought over to this country. And back then, he just went to Canada for a night and came back and he was a permanent citizen because they needed him to serve in World War II. Now, not so easy. The Dreamers are our future. The Dreamers are so important in Nevada and the best way we can get this done is to beat Donald Trump, but it is to pass comprehensive immigration reform.

I have won every race down to fourth grade. A lot of boasting up here, so I thought I’d add that. Secondly, you need someone who can govern. I have passed over 100 bills as the lead Democrat. Third, you need someone that has the heart to be the president. They were talking a lot about heart conditions up here. We have a president right now that doesn’t have a heart. I love the people of this country. I ask for the vote of the people of Nevada because this state gets it.

Then we should, as a society, try to hold them accountable so the next time they go before the voters, if they haven’t done the job we shouldn’t just say, “Oh nice person, gives a good speech.” We should say, “Didn’t do the job and you’re out of here.”",
